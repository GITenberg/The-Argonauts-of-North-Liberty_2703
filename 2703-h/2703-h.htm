    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The bell of the North Liberty Second Presbyterian Church had just ceased
      ringing. North Liberty, Connecticut, never on any day a cheerful town, was
      always bleaker and more cheerless on the seventh, when the Sabbath sun,
      after vainly trying to coax a smile of reciprocal kindliness from the
      drawn curtains and half-closed shutters of the austere dwellings and the
      equally sealed and hard-set churchgoing faces of the people, at last
      settled down into a blank stare of stony astonishment. On this chilly
      March evening of the year 1850, that stare had kindled into an offended
      sunset and an angry night that furiously spat sleet and hail in the faces
      of the worshippers, and made them fight their way to the church, step by
      step, with bent heads and fiercely compressed lips, until they seemed to
      be carrying its forbidding portals at the point of their umbrellas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within that sacred but graceless edifice, the rigors of the hour and
      occasion reached their climax. The shivering gas-jets lit up the austere
      pallor of the bare walls, and the hollow, shell-like sweep of colorless
      vacuity behind the cold communion table. The chill of despair and hopeless
      renunciation was in the air, untempered by any glow from the sealed
      air-tight stove that seemed only to bring out a lukewarm exhalation of wet
      clothes and cheaply dyed umbrellas. Nor did the presence of the
      worshippers themselves impart any life to the dreary apartment. Scattered
      throughout the white pews, in dull, shapeless, neutral blotches, rigidly
      separated from each other, they seemed only to accent the colorless church
      and the emptiness of all things. A few children, who had huddled together
      for warmth in one of the back benches and who had became glutinous and
      adherent through moisture, were laboriously drawn out and painfully picked
      apart by a watchful deacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dry, monotonous disturbance of the bell had given way to the strain of
      a bass viol, that had been apparently pitched to the key of the east wind
      without, and the crude complaint of a new harmonium that seemed to bewail
      its limited prospect of ever becoming seasoned or mellowed in its earthly
      tabernacle, and then the singing began. Here and there a human voice
      soared and struggled above the narrow text and the monotonous cadence with
      a cry of individual longing, but was borne down by the dull, trampling
      precision of the others' formal chant. This and a certain muffled raking
      of the stove by the sexton brought the temperature down still lower. A
      sermon, in keeping with the previous performance, in which the chill east
      wind of doctrine was not tempered to any shorn lamb within that dreary
      fold, followed. A spark of human and vulgar interest was momentarily
      kindled by the collection and the simultaneous movement of reluctant hands
      towards their owners' pockets; but the coins fell on the baize-covered
      plates with a dull thud, like clods on a coffin, and the dreariness
      returned. Then there was another hymn and a prolonged moan from the
      harmonium, to which mysterious suggestion the congregation rose and began
      slowly to file into the aisle. For a moment they mingled; there was the
      silent grasping of damp woollen mittens and cold black gloves, and the
      whispered interchange of each other's names with the prefix of &ldquo;Brother&rdquo;
       or &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; and an utter absence of fraternal geniality, and then the
      meeting slowly dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few who had waited until the minister had resumed his hat, overcoat,
      and overshoes, and accompanied him to the door, had already passed out;
      the sexton was turning out the flickering gas jets one by one, when the
      cold and austere silence was broken by a sound&mdash;the unmistakable echo
      of a kiss of human passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the horror-stricken official turned angrily, the figure of a man glided
      from the shadow of the stairs below the organ loft, and vanished through
      the open door. Before the sexton could follow, the figure of a woman
      slipped out of the same portal and with a hurried glance after the first
      retreating figure, turned in the opposite direction and was lost in the
      darkness. By the time the indignant and scandalized custodian had reached
      the portal, they had both melted in the troubled sea of tossing umbrellas
      already to the right and left of him, and pursuit and recognition were
      hopeless.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      The male figure, however, after mingling with his fellow-worshippers to
      the corner of the block, stopped a moment under the lamp-post as if
      uncertain as to the turning, but really to cast a long, scrutinizing look
      towards the scattered umbrellas now almost lost in the opposite direction.
      He was still gazing and apparently hesitating whether to retrace his
      steps, when a horse and buggy rapidly driven down the side street passed
      him. In a brief glance he evidently recognized the driver, and stepping
      over the curbstone called in a brief authoritative voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The occupant of the vehicle pulled up suddenly, leaned from the buggy, and
      said in an astonished tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Demorest! Well! I declare! hold on, and I'll drive up to the curb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; stay where you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker approached the buggy, jumped in beside the occupant,
      refastened the apron, and coolly taking the reins from his companion's
      hand, started the horse forward. The action was that of an habitually
      imperious man; and the only recognition he made of the other's ownership
      was the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Home&mdash;to see Joan,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Just drove over from
      Warensboro Station. But what on earth are YOU doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without answering the question, Demorest turned to his companion with the
      same good-natured, half humorous authority. &ldquo;Let your wife wait; take a
      drive with me. I want to talk to you. She'll be just as glad to see you an
      hour later, and it's her fault if I can't come home with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; returned his companion, in a tone of half-annoyed apology.
      &ldquo;She still sticks to her old compact when we first married, that she
      shouldn't be obliged to receive my old worldly friends. And, see here,
      Dick, I thought I'd talked her out of it as regards YOU at least, but
      Parson Thomas has been raking up all the old stories about you&mdash;you
      know that affair of the Fall River widow, and that breaking off of Garry
      Spofferth's match&mdash;and about your horse-racing&mdash;until&mdash;you
      know, she's more set than ever against knowing you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not a bad sort of horse you've got there,&rdquo; interrupted Demorest,
      who usually conducted conversation without reference to alien topics
      suggested by others. &ldquo;Where did you get him? He's good yet for a spin down
      the turnpike and over the bridge. We'll do it, and I'll bring you home
      safely to Mrs. Blandford inside the hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford knew little of horseflesh, but like all men he was not superior
      to this implied compliment to his knowledge. He resigned himself to his
      companion as he had been in the habit of doing, and Demorest hurried the
      horse at a rapid gait down the street until they left the lamps behind,
      and were fully on the dark turnpike. The sleet rattled against the hood
      and leathern apron of the buggy, gusts of fierce wind filled the vehicle
      and seemed to hold it back, but Demorest did not appear to mind it.
      Blandford thrust his hands deeply into his pockets for warmth, and
      contracted his shoulders as if in dogged patience. Yet, in spite of the
      fact that he was tired, cold, and anxious to see his wife, he was
      conscious of a secret satisfaction in submitting to the caprices of this
      old friend of his boyhood. After all, Dick Demorest knew what he was
      about, and had never led him astray by his autocratic will. It was safe to
      let Dick have his way. It was true it was generally Dick's own way&mdash;but
      he made others think it was theirs too&mdash;or would have been theirs had
      they had the will and the knowledge to project it. He looked up
      comfortably at the handsome, resolute profile of the man who had taken
      selfish possession of him. Many women had done the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose if you were to tell your wife I was going to reform,&rdquo; said
      Demorest, &ldquo;it might be different, eh? She'd want to take me into the
      church&mdash;'another sinner saved,' and all that, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Blandford, earnestly. &ldquo;Joan isn't as rigid as all that, Dick.
      What she's got against you is the common report of your free way of
      living, and that&mdash;come now, you know yourself, Dick, that isn't
      exactly the thing a woman brought up in her style can stand. Why, she
      thinks I'm unregenerate, and&mdash;well, a man can't carry on business
      always like a class meeting. But are you thinking of reforming?&rdquo; he
      continued, trying to get a glimpse of his companion's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps. It depends. Now&mdash;there's a woman I know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, another? and you call this going to reform?&rdquo; interrupted Blandford,
      yet not without a certain curiosity in his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that's just why I think of reforming. For this one isn't exactly
      like any other&mdash;at least as far as I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means you don't know anything about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, and I'll tell you.&rdquo; He drew the reins tightly to accelerate the
      horse's speed, and, half turning to his companion, without, however,
      moving his eyes from the darkness before him, spoke quickly between the
      blasts: &ldquo;I've seen her only half a dozen times. Met her first in 6.40
      train out from Boston last fall. She sat next to me. Covered up with wraps
      and veils; never looked twice at her. She spoke first&mdash;kind of half
      bold, half frightened way. Then got more comfortable and unwound herself,
      you know, and I saw she was young and not bad-looking. Thought she was
      some school-girl out for a lark&mdash;but rather new at it. Inexperienced,
      you know, but quite able to take care of herself, by George! and although
      she looked and acted as if she'd never spoken to a stranger all her life,
      didn't mind the kind of stuff I talked to her. Rather encouraged it; and
      laughed&mdash;such a pretty little odd laugh, as if laughing wasn't in her
      usual line, either, and she didn't know how to manage it. Well, it ended
      in her slipping out at one end of the car when we arrived, while I was
      looking out for a cab for her at the other.&rdquo; He stopped to recover from a
      stronger gust of wind. &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought it a good joke on me, and let
      the thing drop out of my mind, although, mind you, she'd promised to meet
      me a month afterwards at the same time and place. Well, when the day came
      I happened to be in Boston, and went to the station. Don't know why I
      went, for I didn't for a moment think she'd keep her appointment. First, I
      couldn't find her in the train, but after we'd started she came along out
      of some seat in the corner, prettier than ever, holding out her hand.&rdquo; He
      drew a long inspiration. &ldquo;You can bet your life, Ned, I didn't let go that
      little hand the rest of the journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His passion, or what passed for it, seemed to impart its warmth to the
      vehicle, and even stirred the chilled pulses of the man beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who and what was she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't find out; don't know now. For the first thing she made me promise
      was not to follow her, nor to try to know her name. In return she said she
      would meet me again on another train near Hartford. She did&mdash;and
      again and again&mdash;but always on the train for about an hour, going or
      coming. Then she missed an appointment. I was regularly cut up, I tell
      you, and swore as she hadn't kept her word, I wouldn't keep mine, and
      began to hunt for her. In the midst of it I saw her accidentally; no
      matter where; I followed her to&mdash;well, that's no matter to you,
      either. Enough that I saw her again&mdash;and, well, Ned, such is the
      influence of that girl over me that, by George! she made me make the same
      promise again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford, a little disappointed at his friend's dogmatic suppression of
      certain material facts, shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that's all your story,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I must say I see no prospect of your
      reforming. It's the old thing over again, only this time you are evidently
      the victim. She's some designing creature who will have you if she hasn't
      already got you completely in her power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you're talking about, Ned, and you'd better quit,&rdquo;
       returned Demorest, with cheerful authoritativeness. &ldquo;I tell you that
      that's the sort of girl I'm going to marry, if I can, and settle down
      upon. You can make a memorandum of that, old man, if you like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don't really see why you want to talk to ME about it. And if you
      are thinking that such a story would go down for a moment with Joan as an
      evidence of your reformation, you're completely out, Dick. Was that your
      idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I can tell you, you're wrong again, Ned. You don't know
      anything about women. You do just as I say&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;and
      don't interfere with your own wrong-headed opinions of what other people
      will think, and I'll take the risks of Mrs. Blandford giving me good
      advice. Your wife has got a heap more sense on these subjects than you
      have, you bet. You just tell her that I want to marry the girl and want
      her to help me&mdash;that I mean business, this time&mdash;and you'll see
      how quick she'll come down. That's all I want of you. Will you or won't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an outward expression of sceptical consideration and an inward
      suspicion of the peculiar force of this man's dogmatic insight, Blandford
      assented, with, I fear, the mental reservation of telling the story to his
      wife in his own way. He was surprised when his friend suddenly drew the
      horse up sharply, and after a moment's pause began to back him, cramp the
      wheels of the buggy and then skilfully, in the almost profound darkness,
      turn the vehicle and horse completely round to the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not going over the bridge?&rdquo; said Blandford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demorest made an imperative gesture of silence. The tumultuous rush and
      roar of swollen and rapid water came from the darkness behind them.
      &ldquo;There's been another break-out somewhere, and I reckon the bridge has got
      all it can do to-night to keep itself out of water without taking us over.
      At least, as I promised to set you down at your wife's door inside of the
      hour, I don't propose to try.&rdquo; As the horse now travelled more easily with
      the wind behind him, Demorest, dismissing abruptly all other subjects,
      laid his hand with brusque familiarity on his companion's knee, and as if
      the hour for social and confidential greeting had only just then arrived,
      said: &ldquo;Well, Neddy, old boy, how are you getting on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said Blandford, dubiously. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he began, argumentatively,
      &ldquo;in my business there's a good deal of competition, and I was only saying
      this morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But either Demorest was already familiar with his friend's arguments, or
      had as usual exhausted his topic, for without paying the slightest
      attention to him, he again demanded abruptly, &ldquo;Why don't you go to
      California? Here everything's played out. That's the country for a young
      man like you&mdash;just starting into life, and without incumbrances. If I
      was free and fixed in my family affairs like you I'd go to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was such an occult positivism in Demorest's manner that for an
      instant Blandford, who had been married two years, and was transacting a
      steady and fairly profitable manufacturing business in the adjacent town,
      actually believed he was more fitted for adventurous speculation than the
      grimly erratic man of energetic impulses and pleasures beside him. He
      managed to stammer hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's Joan&mdash;she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Let her stay with her mother; you sell out your interest in the
      business, put the money into an assorted cargo, and clap it and yourself
      into the first ship out of Boston&mdash;and there you are. You've been
      married going on two years now, and a little separation until you've built
      up a business out there, won't do either of you any harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford, who was very much in love with his wife, was not, however,
      above putting the onus of embarrassing affection upon HER. &ldquo;You don't
      know, Joan, Dick,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She'd never consent to a separation, even
      for a short time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try her. She's a sensible woman&mdash;a deuced sight more than you are.
      You don't understand women, Ned. That's what's the matter with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It required all of Blandford's fond memories of his wife's conservative
      habits, Puritan practicality, religious domesticity, and strong family
      attachments, to withstand Demorest's dogmatic convictions. He smiled,
      however, with a certain complacency, as he also recalled the previous
      autumn when the first news of the California gold discovery had penetrated
      North Liberty, and he had expressed to her his belief that it would offer
      an outlet to Demorest's adventurous energy. She had received it with
      ill-disguised satisfaction, and the remark that if this exodus of Mammon
      cleared the community of the godless and unregenerate it would only be
      another proof of God's mysterious providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the tumultuous wind at their backs it was not long before the buggy
      rattled once more over the cobble-stones of the town. Under the direction
      of his friend, Demorest, who still retained possession of the reins, drove
      briskly down a side street of more pretentious dwellings, where Blandford
      lived. One or two wayfarers looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so fast, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? I want to bring you up to your door in style.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but&mdash;it's Sunday. That's my house, the corner one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had stopped before a square, two-storied brick house, with an equally
      square wooden porch supported by two plain, rigid wooden columns, and a
      hollow sweep of dull concavity above the door, evidently of the same
      architectural order as the church. There was no corner or projection to
      break the force of the wind that swept its smooth glacial surface; there
      was no indication of light or warmth behind its six closed windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There seems to be nobody at home,&rdquo; said Demorest, briefly. &ldquo;Come along
      with me to the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan sits in the back parlor, Sundays,&rdquo; explained the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I drive round to the barn and leave the horse and buggy there while
      you go in?&rdquo; continued Demorest, good-humoredly, pointing to the stable
      gate at the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; returned Blandford, &ldquo;it's locked, and I'll have to open
      it from the other side after I go in. The horse will stand until then. I
      think I'll have to say good-night, now,&rdquo; he added, with a sudden
      half-ashamed consciousness of the forbidding aspect of the house, and his
      own inhospitality. &ldquo;I'm sorry I can't ask you in&mdash;but you understand
      why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Demorest, stoutly, turning up his coat-collar, and
      unfurling his umbrella. &ldquo;The hotel is only four blocks away&mdash;you'll
      find me there to-morrow morning if you call. But mind you tell your wife
      just what I told you&mdash;and no meandering of your own&mdash;you hear!
      She'll strike out some idea with her woman's wits, you bet. Good-night,
      old man!&rdquo; He reached out his hand, pressed Blandford's strongly and
      potentially, and strode down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blandford hitched his steaming horse to a sleet-covered horse block with a
      quick sigh of impatient sympathy over the animal and himself, and after
      fumbling in his pocket for a latchkey, opened the front door. A vista of
      well-ordered obscurity with shadowy trestle-like objects against the
      walls, and an odor of chill decorum, as if of a damp but respectable
      funeral, greeted him on entering. A faint light, like a cold dawn, broke
      through the glass pane of a door leading to the kitchen. Blandford paused
      in the mid-darkness and hesitated. Should he first go to his wife in the
      back parlor, or pass silently through the kitchen, open the back gate, and
      mercifully bestow his sweating beast in the stable? With the reflection
      that an immediate conjugal greeting, while his horse was still exposed to
      the fury of the blast in the street, would necessarily be curtailed and
      limited, he compromised by quickly passing through the kitchen into the
      stable yard, opening the gate, and driving horse and vehicle under the
      shed to await later and more thorough ministration. As he entered the back
      door, a faint hope that his wife might have heard him and would be waiting
      for him in the hall for an instant thrilled him; but he remembered it was
      Sunday, and that she was probably engaged in some devotional reading or
      exercise. He hesitatingly opened the back-parlor door with a consciousness
      of committing some unreasonable trespass, and entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there, sitting quietly before a large, round, shining
      centre-table, whose sterile emptiness was relieved only by a shaded lamp
      and a large black and gilt open volume. A single picture on the opposite
      wall&mdash;the portrait of an elderly gentleman stiffened over a
      corresponding volume, which he held in invincible mortmain in his rigid
      hand, and apparently defied posterity to take from him&mdash;seemed to
      offer a not uncongenial companionship. Yet the greenish light of the shade
      fell upon a young and pretty face, despite the color it extracted from it,
      and the hand that supported her low white forehead over which her full
      hair was simply parted, like a brown curtain, was slim and gentle-womanly.
      In spite of her plain lustreless silk dress, in spite of the formal frame
      of sombre heavy horsehair and mahogany furniture that seemed to set her
      off, she diffused an atmosphere of cleanly grace and prim refinement
      through the apartment. The priestess of this ascetic temple, the
      femininity of her closely covered arms, her pink ears, and a little
      serviceable morocco house-shoe that was visible lower down, resting on the
      carved lion's paw that upheld the centre-table, appeared to be only the
      more accented. And the precisely rounded but softly heaving bosom, that
      was pressed upon the edges of the open book of sermons before her, seemed
      to assert itself triumphantly over the rigors of the volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least so her husband and lover thought, as he moved tenderly towards
      her. She met his first kiss on her forehead; the second, a supererogatory
      one, based on some supposed inefficiency in the first, fell upon a shining
      band of her hair, beside her neck. She reached up her slim hands, caught
      his wrists firmly, and, slightly putting him aside, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Edward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I drove out from Warensboro, so as to get here to-night, as I have to
      return to the city on Tuesday. I thought it would give me a little more
      time with you, Joan,&rdquo; he said, looking around him, and, at last,
      hesitatingly drawing an apparently reluctant chair from its formal
      position at the window. The remembrance that he had ever dared to occupy
      the same chair with her, now seemed hardly possible of credence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was a question of your travelling on the Lord's Day, Edward, I
      would rather you should have waited until to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, with slow
      precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;I&mdash;I thought I'd get here in time for the meeting,&rdquo; he
      said, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And instead, you have driven through the town, I suppose, where everybody
      will see you and talk about it. But,&rdquo; she added, raising her dark eyes
      suddenly to his, &ldquo;where else have you been? The train gets into Warensboro
      at six, and it's only half an hour's drive from there. What have you been
      doing, Edward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was scarcely a felicitous moment for the introduction of Demorest's
      name, and he would have avoided it. But he reflected that he had been
      seen, and he was naturally truthful. &ldquo;I met Dick Demorest near the church,
      and as he had something to tell me, we drove down the turnpike a little
      way&mdash;so as to be out of the town, you know, Joan&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped. Her face had taken upon itself that appalling and exasperating
      calmness of very good people who never get angry, but drive others to
      frenzy by the simple occlusion of an adamantine veil between their own
      feelings and their opponents'. &ldquo;I'll tell you all about it after I've put
      up the horse,&rdquo; he said hurriedly, glad to escape until the veil was lifted
      again. &ldquo;I suppose the hired man is out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope he was in church, Edward, but I trust YOU won't delay
      taking care of that poor dumb brute who has been obliged to minister to
      your and Mr. Demorest's Sabbath pleasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford did not wait for a further suggestion. When the door had closed
      behind him, Mrs. Blandford went to the mantel-shelf, where a grimly
      allegorical clock cut down the hours and minutes of men with a scythe, and
      consulted it with a slight knitting of her pretty eyebrows. Then she fell
      into a vague abstraction, standing before the open book on the
      centre-table. Then she closed it with a snap, and methodically putting it
      exactly in the middle of the top of a black cabinet in the corner, lifted
      the shaded lamp in her hand and passed slowly with it up the stairs to her
      bedroom, where her light steps were heard moving to and fro. In a few
      moments she reappeared, stopping for a moment in the hall with the lighted
      lamp as if to watch and listen for her husband's return. Seen in that
      favorable light, her cheeks had caught a delicate color, and her dark eyes
      shone softly. Putting the lamp down in exactly the same place as before,
      she returned to the cabinet for the book, brought it again to the table,
      opened it at the page where she had placed her perforated cardboard
      book-marker, sat down beside it, and with her hands in her lap and her
      eyes on the page began abstractedly to tear a small piece of paper into
      tiny fragments. When she had reduced it to the smallest shreds, she
      scraped the pieces out of her silk lap and again collected them in the
      pink hollow of her little hand, kneeling down on the scrupulously
      well-swept carpet to peck up with a bird-like action of her thumb and
      forefinger an escaped atom here and there. These and the contents of her
      hand she poured into the chilly cavity of a sepulchral-looking alabaster
      vase that stood on the etagere. Returning to her old seat, and making a
      nest for her clasped fingers in the lap of her dress, she remained in that
      attitude, her shoulders a little narrowed and bent forward, until her
      husband returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've lit the fire in the bedroom for you to change your clothes by,&rdquo; she
      said, as he entered; then evading the caress which this wifely attention
      provoked, by bending still more primly over her book, she added, &ldquo;Go at
      once. You're making everything quite damp here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned in a few moments in his slippers and jacket, but evidently
      found the same difficulty in securing a conjugal and confidential
      contiguity to his wife. There was no apparent social centre or nucleus of
      comfort in the apartment; its fireplace, sealed by an iron ornament like a
      monumental tablet over dead ashes, had its functions superseded by an
      air-tight drum in the corner, warmed at second-hand from the dining-room
      below, and offered no attractive seclusion; the sofa against the wall was
      immovable and formally repellent. He was obliged to draw a chair beside
      the table, whose every curve seemed to facilitate his wife's easy
      withdrawal from side-by-side familiarity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Demorest has been urging me very strongly to go to California, but, of
      course, I spoke of you,&rdquo; he said, stealing his hand into his wife's lap,
      and possessing himself of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blandford slowly lifted her fingers enclosed in his clasping hand and
      placed them in shameless publicity on the volume before her. This implied
      desecration was too much for Blandford; he withdrew his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does that man propose to go with you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Blandford, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he's preoccupied with other matters that he wanted me to talk to you
      about,&rdquo; said her husband, hesitatingly. &ldquo;He is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;continued Mrs. Blandford in the same measured tone, &ldquo;if he
      does not add his own evil company to his advice, it is the best he has
      ever given yet. I think he might have taken another day than the Lord's to
      talk about it, but we must not despise the means nor the hour whence the
      truth comes. Father wanted me to take some reasonable moment to prepare
      you to consider it seriously, and I thought of talking to you about it
      to-morrow. He thinks it would be a very judicious plan. Even Deacon
      Truesdail&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Having sold his invoice of damaged sugar kettles for mining purposes, is
      converted,&rdquo; said Blandford, goaded into momentary testiness by his wife's
      unexpected acquiescence and a sudden recollection of Demorest's prophecy.
      &ldquo;You have changed your opinion, Joan, since last fall, when you couldn't
      bear to think of my leaving you,&rdquo; he added reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't bear to think of your joining the mob of lawless and sinful
      men who use that as an excuse for leaving their wives and families. As for
      my own feelings, Edward, I have never allowed them to stand between me and
      what I believed best for our home and your Christian welfare. Though I
      have no cause to admire the influence that I find this man, Demorest,
      still holds over you, I am willing to acquiesce, as you see, in what he
      advises for your good. You can hardly reproach ME, Edward, for worldly or
      selfish motives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford felt keenly the bitter truth of his wife's speech. For the
      moment he would gladly have exchanged it for a more illogical and selfish
      affection, but he reflected that he had married this religious girl for
      the security of an affection which he felt was not subject to the
      temptations of the world&mdash;or even its own weakness&mdash;as was too
      often the case with the giddy maidens whom he had known through Demorest's
      companionship. It was, therefore, more with a sense of recalling this
      distinctive quality of his wife than any loyalty to Demorest that he
      suddenly resolved to confide to her the latter's fatuous folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, dear,&rdquo; he said, apologetically, &ldquo;and we'll talk it over
      to-morrow, and it may be possible to arrange it so that you shall go with
      me. But, speaking of Demorest, I think you don't quite do HIM justice. He
      really respects YOUR feelings and your knowledge of right and wrong more
      than you imagine. I actually believe he came here to-night merely to get
      me to interest you in an extraordinary love affair of his. I mean, Joan,&rdquo;
       he added hastily, seeing the same look of dull repression come over her
      face, &ldquo;I mean, Joan&mdash;that is, you know, from all I can judge&mdash;it
      is something really serious this time. He intends to reform. And this is
      because he has become violently smitten with a young woman whom he has
      only seen half a dozen times, at long intervals, whom he first met in a
      railway train, and whose name and residence he don't even know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an ominous silence&mdash;so hushed that the ticking of the
      allegorical clock came like a grim monitor. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blandford,
      in a hard, dry voice that her alarmed husband scarcely recognized, &ldquo;he
      proposed to insult your wife by taking her into his shameful confidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens! Joan, no&mdash;you don't understand. At the worst, this is
      some virtuous but silly school-girl, who, though she may be intending only
      an innocent flirtation with him, has made this man actually and deeply in
      love with her. Yes; it is a fact, Joan. I know Dick Demorest, and if ever
      there was a man honestly in love, it is he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you mean to say that this man&mdash;an utter stranger to me&mdash;a
      man whom I've never laid my eyes on&mdash;whom I wouldn't know if I met in
      the street&mdash;expects me to advise him&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo; She
      stopped. Blandford could scarcely believe his senses. There were tears in
      her eyes&mdash;this woman who never cried; her voice trembled&mdash;she
      who had always controlled her emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took advantage of this odd but opportune melting. He placed his arm
      around her shoulders. She tried to escape it, but with a coy, shy
      movement, half hysterical, half girlish, unlike her usual stony, moral
      precision. &ldquo;Yes, Joan,&rdquo; he repeated, laughingly, &ldquo;but whose fault is it?
      Not HIS, remember! And I firmly believe he thinks you can do him good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he has never seen me,&rdquo; she continued, with a nervous little laugh,
      &ldquo;and probably considers me some old Gorgon&mdash;like&mdash;like&mdash;Sister
      Jemima Skerret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford smiled with the complacency of far-reaching masculine intuition.
      Ah! that shrewd fellow, Demorest, was right. Joan, dear Joan, was only a
      woman after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he'll be the more agreeably astonished,&rdquo; he returned, gayly, &ldquo;and I
      think YOU will, too, Joan. For Dick isn't a bad-looking fellow; most women
      like him. It's true,&rdquo; he continued, much amused at the novelty of the
      perfectly natural toss and grimace with which Mrs. Blandford received this
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he's been pointed out to me somewhere,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully;
      &ldquo;he's a tall, dark, dissipated-looking man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind,&rdquo; laughed her husband. &ldquo;He's middle-sized and as
      blond as your cousin Joe, only he's got a long yellow moustache, and has a
      quick, abrupt way of talking. He isn't at all fancy-looking; you'd take
      him for an energetic business man or a doctor, if you didn't know him. So
      you see, Joan, this correct little wife of mine has been a little, just a
      little, prejudiced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her again gently backwards and nearer his seat, but she caught his
      wrists in her slim hands, and rising from the chair at the same moment,
      dexterously slipped from his embrace with her back towards him. &ldquo;I do not
      know why I should be unprejudiced by anything you've told me,&rdquo; she said,
      sharply closing the book of sermons, and, with her back still to her
      husband, reinstating it formally in its place on the cabinet. &ldquo;It's
      probably one of his many scandalous pursuits of defenceless and believing
      women, and he, no doubt, goes off to Boston, laughing at you for thinking
      him in earnest; and as ready to tell his story to anybody else and boast
      of his double deceit.&rdquo; Her voice had a touch of human asperity in it now,
      which he had never before noticed, but recognizing, as he thought, the
      human cause, it was far from exciting his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong again, Joan; he's waiting here at the Independence House for me to
      see him to-morrow,&rdquo; he returned, cheerfully. &ldquo;And I believe him so much in
      earnest that I would be ready to swear that not another person will ever
      know the story but you and I and he. No, it is a real thing with him; he's
      dead in love, and it's your duty as a Christian to help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of silence. Mrs. Blandford remained by the cabinet,
      methodically arranging some small articles displaced by the return of the
      book. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, suddenly, &ldquo;you don't tell me what mother had to
      say. Of course, as you came home earlier than you expected, you had time
      to stop THERE&mdash;only four doors from this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no, Joan,&rdquo; replied Blandford, in awkward discomfiture. &ldquo;You see I
      met Dick first, and then&mdash;then I hurried here to you&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I
      clean forgot it. I'm very sorry,&rdquo; he added, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I more deeply so,&rdquo; she returned, with her previous bloodless moral
      precision, &ldquo;for she probably knows by this time, Edward, why you have
      omitted your usual Sabbath visit, and with WHOM you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can pull on my boots again and run in there for a moment,&rdquo; he
      suggested, dubiously, &ldquo;if you think it necessary. It won't take me a
      moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, positively; &ldquo;it is so late now that your visit would only
      show it to be a second thought. I will go myself&mdash;it will be a call
      for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But shall I go with you to the door? It is dark and sleeting,&rdquo; suggested
      Blandford, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she replied, peremptorily. &ldquo;Stay where you are, and when Ezekiel and
      Bridget come in send them to bed, for I have made everything fast in the
      kitchen. Don't wait up for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She left the room, and in a few moments returned, wrapped from head to
      foot in an enormous plaid shawl. A white woollen scarf thrown over her
      bare brown head, and twice rolled around her neck, almost concealed her
      face from view. When she had parted from her husband, and reached the
      darkened hall below, she drew from beneath the folds of her shawl a thick
      blue veil, with which she completely enveloped her features. As she opened
      the front door and peered out into the night, her own husband would have
      scarcely recognized her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her head lowered against the keen wind she walked rapidly down the
      street and stopped for an instant at the door of the fourth house.
      Glancing quickly back at the house she had left and then at the closed
      windows of the one she had halted before, she gathered her skirts with one
      hand and sped away from both, never stopping until she reached the door of
      the Independence Hotel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blandford entered the side door boldly. Luckily for her, the
      austerities of the Sabbath were manifest even here; the bar-room was
      closed, and the usual loungers in the passages were absent. Without
      risking the recognition of her voice in an inquiry to the clerk, she
      slipped past the office, still muffled in her veil, and quickly mounted
      the narrow staircase. For an instant she hesitated before the public
      parlor, and glanced dubiously along the half-lit corridor. Chance
      befriended her; the door of a bedroom opened at that moment, and Richard
      Demorest, with his overcoat and hat on, stepped out in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick and nervous gesture of her hand she beckoned him to approach.
      He came towards her leisurely, with an amused curiosity that suddenly
      changed to utter astonishment as she hurriedly lifted her veil, dropped
      it, turned, and glided down the staircase into the street again. He
      followed rapidly, but did not overtake her until she had reached the
      corner, when she slackened her pace an instant for him to join her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lulu,&rdquo; he said eagerly; &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word here,&rdquo; she said, breathlessly. &ldquo;Follow me at a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started forward again in the direction of her own house. He followed
      her at a sufficient interval to keep her faintly distinguishable figure in
      sight until she had crossed three streets, and near the end of the next
      block glided up the steps of a house not far from the one where he
      remembered to have left Blandford. As he joined her, she had just
      succeeded in opening the door with a pass-key, and was awaiting him. With
      a gesture of silence she took his hand in her cold fingers, and leading
      him softly through the dark hall and passage, quickly entered the kitchen.
      Here she lit a candle, turned, and faced him. He could see that the
      outside shutters were bolted, and the kitchen evidently closed for the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she removed the veil from her face he made a movement as if to regain
      her hand again, but she drew it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forced this upon me,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;and it may be ruin to
      us both. Why have you betrayed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Betrayed you, Lulu&mdash;Good God! what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked him full in the eye, and then said slowly, &ldquo;Do you mean to say
      that you have told no one of our meetings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one&mdash;my old friend Blandford, who lives&mdash;Ah, yes! I see it
      now. You are neighbors. He has betrayed me. This house is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's!&rdquo; she replied boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentary uneasiness passed from Demorest's resolute face. His old
      self-sufficiency returned. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, with a frank laugh, &ldquo;that will
      do for me. Open the door there, Lulu, and take me to him. I'm not ashamed
      of anything I've done, my girl, nor need you be. I'll tell him my real
      name is Dick Demorest, as I ought to have told you before, and that I want
      to marry you, fairly and squarely, and let him make the conditions. I'm
      not a vagabond nor a thief, Lulu, if I have met you on the sly. Come,
      dear, let us end this now. Come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she had thrown herself before him and placed her hand upon his lips.
      &ldquo;Hush! are you mad? Listen to me, I tell you&mdash;please&mdash;oh, do&mdash;no
      you must not!&rdquo; He had covered her hand with kisses and was drawing her
      face towards his own. &ldquo;No&mdash;not again, it was wrong then, it is
      monstrous now. I implore you, listen, if you love me, stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He released her. She sank into a chair by the kitchen-table, and buried
      her flushed face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment motionless before her. &ldquo;Lulu, if that is your name,&rdquo;
       he said slowly, but gently, &ldquo;tell me all now. Be frank with me, and trust
      me. If there is anything stands in the way, let me know what it is and I
      can overcome it. If it is my telling Ned Blandford, don't let that worry
      you, he's as loyal a fellow as ever breathed, and I'm a dog to ever think
      he willingly betrayed us. His wife, well, she's one of those pious saints&mdash;but
      no, she would not be such a cursed hypocrite and bigot as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, I tell you! WILL you hush,&rdquo; she said, in a frantic whisper,
      springing to her feet and grasping him convulsively by the lapels of his
      overcoat. &ldquo;Not a word more, or I'll kill myself. Listen! Do you know what
      I brought you here for? why I left my&mdash;this house and dragged you out
      of your hotel? Well, it was to tell you that you must leave me, leave HERE&mdash;go
      out of this house and out of this town at once, to-night! And never look
      on it or me again! There! you have said we must end this now. It is ended,
      as only it could and ever would end. And if you open that door except to
      go, or if you attempt to&mdash;to touch me again, I'll do something
      desperate. There!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw him off again and stepped back, strangely beautiful in the
      loosened shackles of her long repressed human emotion. It was as if the
      passion-rent robes of the priestess had laid bare the flesh of the woman
      dazzling and victorious. Demorest was fascinated and frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not love me?&rdquo; he said with a constrained smile, &ldquo;and I am a
      fool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love you!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Love you,&rdquo; she continued, bowing her brown head
      over her hanging arms and clasped hands. &ldquo;What then has brought me to
      this? Oh,&rdquo; she said suddenly, again seizing him by his two arms, and
      holding him from her with a half-prudish, half-passionate gesture, &ldquo;why
      could you not have left things as they were; why could we not have met in
      the same old way we used to meet, when I was so foolish and so happy? Why
      could you spoil that one dream I have clung to? Why didn't you leave me
      those few days of my wretched life when I was weak, silly, vain, but not
      the unhappy woman I am now. You were satisfied to sit beside me and talk
      to me then. You respected my secret, my reserve. My God! I used to think
      you loved me as I loved you&mdash;for THAT! Why did you break your promise
      and follow me here? I believed you the first day we met, when you said
      there was no wrong in my listening to you; that it should go no further;
      that you would never seek to renew it without my consent. You tell me I
      don't love you, and I tell you now that we must part, that frightened as I
      was, foolish as I was, that day was the first day I had ever lived and
      felt as other women live and feel. If I ran away from you then it was
      because I was running away from my old self too. Don't you understand me?
      Could you not have trusted me as I trusted you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I broke my promise only when you broke yours. When you would not meet me
      I followed you here, because I loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is why you must leave me now,&rdquo; she said, starting from his
      outstretched arms again. &ldquo;Do not ask me why, but go, I implore you. You
      must leave this town to-night, to-morrow will be too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He cast a hurried glance around him, as if seeking to gather some reason
      for this mysterious haste, or a clue for future identification. He saw
      only the Sabbath-sealed cupboards, the cold white china on the dresser,
      and the flicker of the candle on the partly-opened glass transom above the
      door. &ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; he said, with quiet sadness. &ldquo;I will go now, and
      leave the town to-night; but&rdquo;&mdash;his voice struck its old imperative
      note&mdash;&ldquo;this shall not end here, Lulu. There will be a next time, and
      I am bound to win you yet, in spite of all and everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a half-frightened, half-hysterical light in her
      eyes. &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will be frank with me then, and tell me all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, another time; but go now.&rdquo; She had extinguished the candle,
      turned the handle of the door noiselessly, and was holding it open. A
      faint light stole through the dark passage. She drew back hastily. &ldquo;You
      have left the front door open,&rdquo; she said in a frightened voice. &ldquo;I thought
      you had shut it behind me,&rdquo; he returned quickly. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; He drew her
      towards him. She resisted slightly. They were for an instant clasped in a
      passionate embrace; then there was a sudden collapse of the light and a
      dull jar. The front door had swung to.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a desperate bound she darted into the passage and through the hall,
      dragging him by the hand, and threw the front door open. Without, the
      street was silent and empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she whispered frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demorest passed quickly down the steps and disappeared. At the same moment
      a voice came from the banisters of the landing above. &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's I, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so. And it's like Edward to bring you and sneak off in that
      fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Blandford gave a quick sigh of relief. Demorest's flight had been
      mistaken for her husband's habitual evasion. Knowing that her mother would
      not refer to the subject again, she did not reply, but slowly mounted the
      dark staircase with an assumption of more than usual hesitating
      precaution, in order to recover her equanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clocks were striking eleven when she left her mother's house and
      re-entered her own. She was surprised to find a light burning in the
      kitchen, and Ezekiel, their hired man, awaiting her in a dominant and
      nasal key of religious and practical disapprobation. &ldquo;Pity you wern't tu
      hum afore, ma'am, considerin' the doins that's goin' on in perfessed
      Christians' houses arter meetin' on the Sabbath Day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the difficulty now, Ezekiel?&rdquo; said Mrs. Blandford, who had
      regained her rigorous precision once more under the decorous security of
      her own roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, here comes an entire stranger axin for Squire Blandford. And when
      I tells he warn't tu hum&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at home?&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Blandford, with a slight start. &ldquo;I left
      him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbee so, but folks nowadays don't 'pear to keer much whether they break
      the Sabbath or not, trapsen' raound town in and arter meetin' hours, ez if
      'twor gin'ral tranin' day&mdash;and hez gone out agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mrs. Blandford, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, the stranger sez, sez he, 'Show me the way to the stables,' sez
      he, and without taken' no for an answer, ups and meanders through the
      hall, outer the kitchen inter the yard, ez if he was justice of the peace;
      and when he gets there he sez, 'Fetch out his hoss and harness up, and be
      blamed quick about it, and tell Ned Blandford that Dick Demorest hez got
      to leave town to-night, and ez ther ain't a blamed puritanical shadbelly
      in this hull town ez would let a hoss go on hire Sunday night, he guesses
      he'll hev to borry his.' And afore I could say Jack Robinson, he tackles
      the hoss up and drives outer the yard, flinging this
      two-dollar-and-a-half-piece behind him ez if I wur a Virginia slave and he
      was John C. Calhoun hisself. I'd a chucked it after him if it hadn't been
      the Lord's Day, and it mout hev provoked disturbance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Demorest is worldly, but one of Edward's old friends,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Blandford, with a slight kindling of her eyes, &ldquo;and he would not have
      refused to aid him in what might be an errand of grace or necessity. You
      can keep the money, Ezekiel, as a gift, not as a wage. And go to bed. I
      will sit up for Mr. Blandford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed out and up the staircase into her bedroom, pausing on her way
      to glance into the empty back parlor and take the lamp from the table.
      Here she noticed that her husband had evidently changed his clothes again
      and taken a heavier overcoat from the closet. Removing her own wraps she
      again descended to the lower apartment, brought out the volume of sermons,
      placed it and the lamp in the old position, and with her abstracted eyes
      on the page fell into her former attitude. Every suggestion of the
      passionate, half-frenzied woman in the kitchen of the house only four
      doors away, had vanished; one would scarcely believe she had ever stirred
      from the chair in which she had formally received her husband two hours
      before. And yet she was thinking of herself and Demorest in that kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His prompt and decisive response to her appeal, as shown in this last bold
      and characteristic action, relieved, while it half piqued her. But the
      overruling destiny which had enabled her to bring him from his hotel to
      her mother's house unnoticed, had protected them while there, had arrested
      a dangerous meeting between him and herself and her husband in her own
      house, impressed her more than all. It imparted to her a hideous
      tranquillity born of the doctrines of her youth&mdash;Predestination! She
      reflected with secret exultation that her moral resolution to fly from him
      and her conscientiously broken promise had been the direct means of
      bringing him there; that step by step circumstances not in themselves evil
      or to be combated had led her along; that even her husband and mother had
      felt it their duty to assist towards this fateful climax! If Edward had
      never kept up his worldly friendship, if she had never been restricted and
      compassed in her own; if she had ever known the freedom of other girls,&mdash;all
      this might not have happened. She had been elected to share with Demorest
      and her husband the effects of their ungodliness. She was no longer a free
      agent; what availed her resolutions? To Demorest's imperious hope, she had
      said, &ldquo;God knows.&rdquo; What more could she say? Her small red lips grew white
      and compressed; her face rigid, her eyes hollow and abstracted; she looked
      like the genius of asceticism as she sat there, grimly formulating a
      dogmatic explanation of her lawless and unlicensed passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had risen to a gale without, and stirred even the sealed
      sepulchre of the fireplace with dull rumblings and muffled moans. At times
      the hot-air drum in the corner seemed to expand as with some pent-up
      emotion. Strange currents of air crossed the empty room like the passage
      of unseen spirits, and she even fancied she heard whispers at the window.
      This caused her to rise and open it, when she found that the sleet had
      given way to a dry feathery snow that was swarming through the slits of
      the shutter; a faint reflection from the already whitened fences glimmered
      in the panes. She shut the window hastily, with a little shiver of cold.
      Where was Demorest in this storm? Would it stop him? She thought with
      pride now of the dominant energy that had frightened her, and knew it
      would not. But her husband?&mdash;what kept him? It was twelve o'clock; he
      had seldom stayed out so late before. During the first half hour of her
      reflections she had been relieved by his absence; she had even believed
      that he had met Demorest in the town, and was not alarmed by it, for she
      knew that the latter would avoid any further confidence, and cut short any
      return to it. But why had not Edward returned? For an instant the terrible
      thought that something had happened, and that they might both return
      together, took possession of her, and she trembled. But no; Demorest, who
      had already taken such extreme measures, could not consistently listen to
      any suggestion for delay. As her only danger lay in Demorest's presence,
      the absence of her husband caused her more undefinable uneasiness than
      actual alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room had become cold with the dying out of the dining-room fire that
      warmed the drum. She would go to bed. She nevertheless arranged the room
      again with a singular impression that she was doing it for the last time
      in her present existing circumstances, and placing the lamp on the table
      in the hall, went up to her own room. By the light of a single candle she
      undressed herself hastily, said her prayers punctiliously, and got into
      bed, with an unexpected relief at finding herself still occupying it
      alone. Then she fell asleep and dreamed of Demorest.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Edward Blandford found himself alone after his wife had undertaken to
      fulfil his abandoned filial duty at her parents' house, he felt a slight
      twinge of self-reproach. He could not deny that this was not the first
      time he had evaded the sterile Sabbath evenings at his mother-in-law's, or
      that even at other times he was not in accord with the cold and colorless
      sanctity of the family. Yet he remembered that when he picked out from the
      budding womanhood of North Liberty this pure, scentless blossom, he had
      endured the privations of its surroundings with a sense of security in
      inhaling the atmosphere in which it grew, and knowing the integrity of its
      descent. There was a certain pleasure also in invading this seclusion with
      human passion; the first pressure of her hand when they were kneeling
      together at family prayers had the zest without the sin of a forbidden
      pleasure; the first kiss he had given her with their heads over the family
      Bible had fairly intoxicated him in the thin, rarefied air of their
      surroundings. In transplanting this blossom to his own home with the fond
      belief that it would eventually borrow the hues and color of his own
      passion, he had no further interest in the house he had left behind. When
      he found, however, that the ancestral influence was stronger than he
      expected, that the young wife, instead of assimilating to his conditions,
      had imported into their little household the rigors of her youthful home,
      he had been chilled and disappointed. But he could not help also
      remembering that his own boyhood had been spent in an atmosphere like her
      own in everything but its sincerity and deep conviction. His father had
      recognized the business value of placating the narrow tyranny of the
      respectable well-to-do religious community, and had become a conscious
      hypocrite and a popular citizen. He had himself been under that influence,
      and it was partly a conviction of this that had drawn him towards her as
      something genuine and real. It occurred to him now for the first time, as
      he looked around upon that compromise of their two lives in this chilly
      artificial home, that it was only natural that she would prefer the more
      truthful austerities of her mother's house. Had she detected the sham, and
      did she despise him for it?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were questions which seemed to bring another self-accusing doubt in
      his own mind, although, without his being conscious of it, they had been
      really the outcome of that doubt. He could not help dwelling on the
      singular human interest she had taken in Demorest's love affair, and the
      utterly unexpected emotion she had shown. He had never seen her as
      charmingly illogical, capricious, and bewitchingly feminine. Had he not
      made a radical mistake in not giving her a frequent provocation for this
      innocent emotion&mdash;in fact, in not taking her out into a world of
      broader sympathies and experiences? What a household they might have had&mdash;if
      necessary in some other town&mdash;away from those cramped prejudices and
      limitations! What friends she might have been with Dick and his other
      worldly acquaintances; what social pleasures&mdash;guiltless amusements
      for her pure mind&mdash;in theatres, parties, and concerts! Would she have
      objected to them?&mdash;had he ever seriously proposed them to her? No! if
      she had objected there would have been time enough to have made this
      present compromise; she would have at least respected and understood his
      sacrifice&mdash;and his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the artificial externals of his household had never before so visibly
      impressed him. Now that she was no longer in the room it did not even bear
      a trace of her habitation, it certainly bore no suggestion of his own. Why
      had he bought that hideous horsehair furniture? To remind her of the old
      provincial heirlooms of her father's sitting-room. Did it remind her of
      it? The stiff and stony emptiness of this room had been fashioned upon the
      decorous respectability of his own father's parlor&mdash;in which his
      father, who usually spent his slippered leisure in the family
      sitting-room, never entered except on visits from the minister. It had
      chilled his own youthful soul&mdash;why had he perpetuated it here?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could only answer these questions by moodily wandering about the house,
      and regretting he had not gone with her. After a vain attempt to establish
      social and domestic relations with the hot-air drum by putting his feet
      upon it&mdash;after an equally futile attempt to extract interest from the
      book of sermons by opening its pages at random&mdash;he glanced at the
      clock and suddenly resolved to go and fetch her. It would remind him of
      the old times when he used to accompany her from church, and, after her
      parents had retired, spend a blissful half-hour alone with her. With what
      a mingling of fear and childish curiosity she used to accept his equally
      timid caresses! Yes, he would go and fetch her; and he would recall it to
      her in a whisper while they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with this idea, when he changed his clothes again he put on a
      certain heavy beaver overcoat, on whose shaggy sleeve her little, hand had
      so often rested when he escorted her from meeting; and he even selected
      the gray muffler she had knit for him in the old ante-nuptial days. It was
      lying in the half-opened drawer from where she had not long before taken
      her disguising veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still blowing in sudden, capricious gusts; and when he opened the
      front door the wind charged fiercely upon him, as if to drive him back.
      When he had finally forced his way into the street, a return current
      closed the door as suddenly and sharply behind him as if it had ejected
      him from his home for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the fourth house quickly, and as quickly ran up the steps; his
      hand was upon the bell when his eye suddenly caught sight of his wife's
      pass-key still in the lock. She had evidently forgotten it. Here was a
      chance to mischievously banter that habitually careful little woman! He
      slipped it into his pocket and quietly entered the dark but perfectly
      familiar hall. He reached the staircase without a stumble and began to
      ascend softly. Halfway up he heard the sound of his wife's hurried voice
      and another that startled him. He ascended hastily two steps, which
      brought him to the level of the half-opened transom of the kitchen. A
      candle was burning on the kitchen table; he could see everything that
      passed in the room; he could hear distinctly every word that was uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not utter a cry or sound; he did not even tremble. He remained so
      rigid and motionless, clutching the banisters with his stiffened fingers,
      that when he did attempt to move, all life, as well as all that had made
      life possible to him, seemed to have died from him for ever. There was no
      nervous illusion, no dimming of his senses; he saw everything with a
      hideous clarity of perception. By some diabolical instantaneous
      photography of the brain, little actions, peculiarities, touches of
      gesture, expression and attitude never before noted by him in his wife,
      were clearly fixed and bitten in his consciousness. He saw the color of
      his friend's overcoat, the reddish tinge of his wife's brown hair, till
      then unnoticed; in that supreme moment he was aware of a sudden likeness
      to her mother; but more terrible than all, there seemed to be a nameless
      sympathetic resemblance that the guilty pair had to each other in gesture
      and movement as of some unhallowed relationship beyond his ken. He knew
      not how long he stood there without breath, without reflection, without
      one connected thought. He saw her suddenly put her hand on the handle of
      the door. He knew that in another moment they would pass almost before
      him. He made a convulsive effort to move, with an inward cry to God for
      support, and succeeded in staggering with outstretched palms against the
      wall, down the staircase, and blindly forward through the hall to the
      front door. As yet he had been able to formulate only one idea&mdash;to
      escape before them, for it seemed to him that their contact meant the ruin
      of them both, of that house, of all that was near to him&mdash;a
      catastrophe that struck blindly at his whole visible world. He had reached
      the door and opened it at the moment that the handle of the kitchen-door
      was turned. He mechanically fell back behind the open door that hid him,
      while it let the cruel light glimmer for a moment on their clasped
      figures. The door slipped from his nerveless fingers and swung to with a
      dull sound. Crouching still in the corner, he heard the quick rush of
      hurrying feet in the darkness, saw the door open and Demorest glide out&mdash;saw
      her glance hurriedly after him, close the door, and involve herself and
      him in the blackness of the hall. Her dress almost touched him in his
      corner; he could feel the near scent of her clothes, and the air stirred
      by her figure retreating towards the stairs; could hear the unlocking of a
      door above and the voice of her mother from the landing, his wife's reply,
      the slow fading of her footsteps on the stairs and overhead, the closing
      of a door, and all was quiet again. Still stooping, he groped for the
      handle of the door, opened it, and the next moment reeled like a drunken
      man down the steps into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well for him that a fierce onset of wind and sleet at that instant
      caught him savagely&mdash;stirred his stagnated blood into action, and
      beat thought once more into his brain. He had mechanically turned towards
      his own home; his first effort of recovering will hurried him furiously
      past it and into a side street. He walked rapidly, but undeviatingly on to
      escape observation and secure some solitude for his returning thoughts.
      Almost before he knew it he was in the open fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of vengeance had never crossed his mind. He was neither a
      physical nor a moral coward, but he had never felt the merely animal fury
      of disputed animal possession which the world has chosen to recognize as a
      proof of outraged sentiment, nor had North Liberty accepted the ethics
      that an exchange of shots equalized a transferred affection. His love had
      been too pure and too real to be moved like the beasts of the field, to
      seek in one brutal passion compensation for another. Killing&mdash;what
      was there to kill? All that he had to live for had been already slain.
      With the love that was in him&mdash;in them&mdash;already dead at his
      feet, what was it to him whether these two hollow lives moved on and
      passed him, or mingled their emptiness elsewhere? Only let them henceforth
      keep out of his way!
    </p>
    <p>
      For in his first feverish flow of thought&mdash;the reaction to his
      benumbed will within and the beating sleet without&mdash;he believed
      Demorest as treacherous as his wife. He recalled his sudden and unexpected
      intrusion into the buggy only a few hours before, his mysterious
      confidences, his assurance of Joan's favorable reception of his secret,
      and her consent to the Californian trip. What had all this meant if not
      that Demorest was using him, the husband, to assist his intrigue, and
      carry the news of his presence in the town to her? And this boldness, this
      assurance, this audacity of conception was like Demorest! While only
      certain passages of the guilty meeting he had just seen and overheard were
      distinctly impressed on his mind, he remembered now, with hideous and
      terrible clearness, all that had gone before. It was part of the disturbed
      and unequal exaltation of his faculties that he dwelt more upon this and
      his wife's previous deceit and manifest hypocrisy, than upon the actual
      evidence he had witnessed of her unfaithfulness. The corroboration of the
      fact was stronger to him than the fact itself. He understood the coldness,
      the uncongeniality now&mdash;the simulated increase of her aversion to
      Demorest&mdash;her journeys to Boston and Hartford to see her relatives,
      her acquiescence to his frequent absences; not an incident, not a
      characteristic of her married life was inconsistent with her guilt and her
      deceit. He went even back to her maidenhood: how did he know this was not
      the legitimate sequence of other secret schoolgirl escapades. The bitter
      worldly light that had been forced upon his simple ingenuous nature had
      dazzled and blinded him. He passed from fatuous credulity to equally
      fatuous distrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped suddenly with the roaring of water before him. In the furious
      following of his rapid thought through storm and darkness he had come, he
      knew not how, upon the bank of the swollen river, whose endangered bridge
      Demorest had turned from that evening. A few steps more and he would have
      fallen into it. He drew nearer and looked at it with vague curiosity. Had
      he come there with any definite intention? The thought sobered without
      frightening him. There was always THAT culmination possible, and to be
      considered coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and began to retrace his steps. On his way thither he had been
      fighting the elements step by step; now they seemed to him to have taken
      possession of him and were hurrying him quickly away. But where? and to
      what? He was always thinking of the past. He had wandered he knew not how
      long, always thinking of that. It was the future he had to consider. What
      was to be done?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard of such cases before; he had read of them in newspapers and
      talked of them with cold curiosity. But they were of worldly, sinful
      people, of dissolute men whose characters he could not conceive&mdash;of
      silly, vain, frivolous, and abandoned women whom he had never even met.
      But Joan&mdash;O God! It was the first time since his mute prayer on the
      staircase that the Divine name had been wrested from his lips. It came
      with his wife's&mdash;and his first tears! But the wind swept the one away
      and dried the others upon his hot cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had ceased to rain, and the wind, which was still high, had shifted
      more to the north and was bitterly cold. He could feel the roadway
      stiffening under his feet. When he reached the pavement of the outskirts
      once more he was obliged to take the middle of the street, to avoid the
      treacherous films of ice that were beginning to glaze the sidewalks. Yet
      this very inclemency, added to the usual Sabbath seclusion, had left the
      streets deserted. He was obliged to proceed more slowly, but he met no one
      and could pursue his bewildering thoughts unchecked. As he passed between
      the lines of cold, colorless houses, from which all light and life had
      vanished, it seemed to him that their occupants were dead as his love, or
      had fled their ruined houses as he had. Why should he remain? Yet what was
      his duty now as a man&mdash;as a Christian? His eye fell on the hideous
      facade of the church he was passing&mdash;her church! He gave a bitter
      laugh and stumbled on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one of the gusts he fancied he heard a familiar sound&mdash;the
      rattling of buggy wheels over the stiffening road. Or was it merely the
      fanciful echo of an idea that only at that moment sprung up in his mind?
      If it was real it came from the street parallel with the one he was in.
      Who could be driving out at this time? What other buggy than his own could
      be found to desecrate this Christian Sabbath? An irresistible thought
      impelled him at the risk of recognition to quicken his pace and turn the
      corner as Richard Demorest drove up to the Independence Hotel, sprang from
      his buggy, throwing the reins over the dashboard, and disappeared into the
      hotel!
    </p>
    <p>
      Blandford stood still, but for an instant only. He had been wandering for
      an hour aimlessly, hopelessly, without consecutive idea, coherent thought
      or plan of action; without the faintest inspiration or suggestion of
      escape from his bewildering torment, without&mdash;he had begun to fear&mdash;even
      the power to conceive or the will to execute; when a wild idea flashed
      upon him with the rattle of his buggy wheels. And even as Demorest
      disappeared into the hotel, he had conceived his plan and executed it. He
      crossed the street swiftly, leaped into his buggy, lifted the reins and
      brought down the whip simultaneously, and the next instant was dashing
      down the street in the direction of the Warensboro turnpike. So sudden was
      the action that by the time the astonished hall porter had rushed into the
      street, horse and buggy had already vanished in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently it began to snow. So lightly at first that it seemed a mere
      passing whisper to the ear, the brush of some viewless insect upon the
      cheek, or the soft tap of unseen fingers on the shoulders. But by the time
      the porter returned from his hopeless and invisible chase of the
      &ldquo;runaway,&rdquo; he came in out of a swarming cloud of whirling flakes, blinded
      and whitened. There was a hurried consultation with the landlord, the
      exhibition of much imperious energy and some bank-notes from Demorest, and
      with a glance at the clock that marked the expiring limit of the Puritan
      Sabbath, the landlord at last consented. By the time the falling snow had
      muffled the street from the indiscreet clamor of Sabbath-breaking hoofs,
      the landlord's noiseless sledge was at the door and Demorest had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow fell all that night; with fierce gusts of wind that moaned in the
      chimneys of North Liberty and sorely troubled the Sabbath sleep of its
      decorous citizens; with deep, passionless silences, none the less fateful,
      that softly precipitated a spotless mantle of merciful obliteration
      equally over their precise or their straying footprints, that would have
      done them good to heed and to remember; and when morning broke upon a
      world of week-day labor, it was covered as far as their eyes could reach
      as with a clear and unwritten tablet, on which they might record their
      lives anew. Near the wreck of the broken bridge on the Warensboro turnpike
      an overturned buggy lay imbedded in the drift and debris of the river
      hurrying silently towards the sea, and a horse with fragments of broken
      and icy harness still clinging to him was found standing before the
      stable-door of Edward Blandford. But to any further knowledge of the fate
      of its owner, North Liberty awoke never again.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last note of the Angelus had just rung out of the crumbling fissures
      in the tower of the mission chapel of San Buena-ventura. The sun which had
      beamed that day and indeed every day for the whole dry season over the
      red-tiled roofs of that old and happily ventured pueblo seemed to broaden
      to a smile as it dipped below the horizon, as if in undiminished enjoyment
      of its old practical joke of suddenly plunging the Southern California
      coast in darkness without any preliminary twilight. The olive and fig
      trees at once lost their characteristic outlines in formless masses of
      shadow; only the twisted trunks of the old pear trees in the mission
      garden retained their grotesque shapes and became gruesome in the
      gathering gloom. The encircling pines beyond closed up their serried
      files; a cool breeze swept down from the coast range and, passing through
      them, sent their day-long heated spices through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was any truth in the local belief that the pious incantation of
      the Angelus bell had the power of excluding all evil influence abroad at
      that perilous hour within its audible radius, and comfortably keeping all
      unbelieving wickedness at a distance, it was presumably ineffective as
      regarded the innovating stage-coach from Monterey that twice a week at
      that hour brought its question-asking, revolver-persuading and
      fortune-seeking load of passengers through the sleepy Spanish town. On the
      night of the 3d of August, 1856, it had not only brought but set down at
      the Posada one of those passengers. It was a Mr. Ezekiel Corwin, formerly
      known to these pages as &ldquo;hired man&rdquo; to the late Squire Blandford, of North
      Liberty, Connecticut, but now a shrewd, practical, self-sufficient, and
      self-asserting unit of the more cautious later Californian immigration. As
      the stage rattled away again with more or less humorous and open
      disparagement of the town and the Posada from its &ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; he lounged
      with lazy but systematic deliberation towards Mateo Morez, the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that some of your folks here couldn't direct me to Dick
      Demorest's house, could ye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senor Mateo Morez was at once perplexed and pained. Pained at the
      ignorance thus forced upon him by a caballero; perplexed as to its
      intention. Between the two he smiled apologetically but gravely, and said:
      &ldquo;No sabe, Senor. I 'ave not understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No more hev I,&rdquo; returned Ezekiel, with patronizing recognition of his
      obtuseness. &ldquo;I guess ez heow you ain't much on American. You folks orter
      learn the language if you kalkilate to keep a hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the momentary vision of a waistless woman with a shawl gathered over
      her head and shoulders at the back door attracted his attention. She said
      something to Mateo in Spanish, and the yellowish-white of Mateo's eyes
      glistened with intelligent comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, posiblemente; it is Don Ricardo Demorest you wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ezekiel's face and manner expressed a mingling of grateful curiosity
      and some scorn at the discovery. &ldquo;Wa'al,&rdquo; he said, looking around as if to
      take the entire Posada into his confidence, &ldquo;way up in North Liberty,
      where I kem from, he was allus known as Dick Demorest, and didn't tack any
      forrin titles to his name. Et wouldn't hev gone down there, I reckon,
      'mongst free-born Merikin citizens, no mor'n aliases would in court&mdash;and
      I kinder guess for the same reason. But folks get peart and sassy when
      they're way from hum, and put on ez many airs as a buck nigger. And so he
      calls hisself Don Ricardo here, does he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Senor knows Don Ricardo?&rdquo; said Mateo politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef you mean me&mdash;wa'al, yes&mdash;I should say so. He was a partiklar
      friend of a man I've known since he was knee-high to a grasshopper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel had actually never seen Demorest but once in his life. He would
      have scorned to lie, but strict accuracy was not essential with an
      ignorant foreign audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up his carpet-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I kin find his house, ef it's anyway handy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Senor Mateo was again politely troubled. The house of Don Ricardo
      was of a truth not more than a mile distant. It was even possible that the
      Senor had observed it above a wall and vineyard as he came into the
      pueblo. But it was late&mdash;it was also dark, as the Senor would himself
      perceive&mdash;and there was still to-morrow. To-morrow&mdash;ah, it was
      always there! Meanwhile there were beds of a miraculous quality at the
      Posada, and a supper such as a caballero might order in his own house.
      Health, discretion, solicitude for oneself&mdash;all pointed clearly to
      to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      What part of this speech Ezekiel understood affected him only as an
      innkeeper's bid for custom, and as such to be steadily exposed and
      disposed of. With the remark that he guessed Dick Demorest's was &ldquo;a good
      enough hotel for HIM,&rdquo; and that he'd better be &ldquo;getting along there,&rdquo; he
      walked down the steps, carpet-bag in hand, and coolly departed, leaving
      Mateo pained, but smiling, on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An animal with a pig's head&mdash;without doubt,&rdquo; said Mateo,
      sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clearly a brigand with the liver of a chicken,&rdquo; responded his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject of this ambiguous criticism, happily oblivious, meantime
      walked doggedly back along the road the stage-coach had just brought him.
      It was badly paved and hollowed in the middle with the worn ruts of a
      century of slow undeviating ox carts, and the passage of water during the
      rainy season. The low adobe houses on each side, with bright
      cinnamon-colored tiles relieving their dark-brown walls, had the regular
      outlines of their doors and windows obliterated by the crumbling of years,
      until they looked as if they had been afterthoughts of the builder, rudely
      opened by pick and crowbar, and finished by the gentle auxiliary
      architecture of birds and squirrels. Yet these openings at times permitted
      glimpses of a picturesque past in the occasional view of a lace-edged
      pillow or silken counterpane, striped hangings, or dyed Indian rugs, the
      flitting of a flounced petticoat or flower-covered head, or the indolent
      leaning figure framed in a doorway of a man in wide velvet trousers and
      crimson-barred serape, whose brown face was partly hidden in a yellow
      nimbus of cigarette smoke. Even in the semi-darkness, Ezekiel's
      penetrating and impertinent eyes took eager note of these facts with
      superior complacency, quite unmindful, after the fashion of most critical
      travellers, of the hideous contrast of his own long shapeless nankeen
      duster, his stiff half-clerical brown straw hat, his wisp of gingham
      necktie, his dusty boots, his outrageous carpet-bag, and his straggling
      goat-like beard. A few looked at him in grave, discreet wonder. Whether
      they recognized in him the advent of a civilization that was destined to
      supplant their own ignorant, sensuous, colorful life with austere
      intelligence and rigid practical improvement, did not appear. He walked
      steadily on. As he passed the low arched door of the mission church and
      saw a faint light glimmering from the side windows, he had indeed a weak
      human desire to go in and oppose in his own person a debased and
      idolatrous superstition with some happily chosen question that would
      necessarily make the officiating priest and his congregation exceedingly
      uncomfortable. But he resisted; partly in the hope of meeting some
      idolater on his way to Benediction, and, in the guise of a stranger
      seeking information, dropping a few unpalatable truths; and partly because
      he could unbosom himself later to Demorest, who he was not unwilling to
      believe had embraced Popery with his adoption of a Spanish surname and
      title.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had become quite dark when he reached the long wall that enclosed
      Demorest's premises. The wall itself excited his resentment, not only as
      indicating an exclusiveness highly objectionable in a man who had
      emigrated from a free State, but because he, Ezekiel Corwin, had
      difficulty in discovering the entrance. When he succeeded, he found
      himself before an iron gate, happily open, but savoring offensively of
      feudalism and tyrannical proprietorship, and passed through and entered an
      avenue of trees scarcely distinguishable in the darkness, whose mysterious
      shapes and feathery plumes were unknown to him. Numberless odors equally
      vague and mysterious were heavy in the air, strange and delicate plants
      rose dimly on either hand; enormous blossoms, like ghostly faces, seemed
      to peer at him from the shadows. For an instant Ezekiel succumbed to an
      unprofitable sense of beauty, and acquiesced in this reckless extravagance
      of Nature that was so unlike North Liberty. But the next moment he
      recovered himself, with the reflection that it was probably unhealthy, and
      doggedly approached the house. It was a long, one-storied, structure,
      apparently all roof, vine, and pillared veranda. Every window and door was
      open; the two or three grass hammocks swung emptily between the columns;
      the bamboo chairs and settees were vacant; his heavy footsteps on the
      floor had summoned no attendant; not even a dog had barked as he
      approached the house. It was shiftless, it was sinful&mdash;it boded no
      good to the future of Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put down his carpet-bag on the veranda and entered the broad hall,
      where an old-fashioned lantern was burning on a stand. Here, too, the
      doors of the various apartments were open, and the rooms themselves empty
      of occupants. An opportunity not to be lost by Ezekiel's inquiring mind
      thus offered itself. He took the lantern and deliberately examined the
      several apartments, the furniture, the bedding, and even the small
      articles that were on the tables and mantels. When he had completed the
      round&mdash;including a corridor opening on a dark courtyard, which he did
      not penetrate&mdash;he returned to the hall, and set down the lantern
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said a voice in his own familiar vernacular, &ldquo;I hope you like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel was surprised, but not disconcerted. What he had taken in the
      shadow for a bundle of serapes lying on the floor of the veranda, was the
      recumbent figure of a man who now raised himself to a sitting posture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ez to that,&rdquo; drawled Ezekiel, with unshaken self-possession, &ldquo;whether I
      like it or not ez only a question betwixt kempany manners and
      truth-telling. Beggars hadn't oughter be choosers, and transient visitors
      like myself needn't allus speak their mind. But if you mean to signify
      that with every door and window open and universal shiftlessness lying
      round everywhere temptin' Providence, you ain't lucky in havin' a
      feller-citizen of yours drop in on ye instead of some Mexican thief, I
      don't agree with ye&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man laughed shortly and rose up. In spite of his careless yet
      picturesque Mexican dress, Ezekiel instantly recognized Demorest. With his
      usual instincts he was naturally pleased to observe that he looked older
      and more careworn. The softer, sensuous climate had perhaps imparted a
      heaviness to his figure and a deliberation to his manner that was quite
      unlike his own potential energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don't tell me who you are, and what you want,&rdquo; he said, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al then, I'm Ezekiel Corwin of North Liberty, ez used to live with my
      friend and YOURS too, I guess&mdash;seein' how the friendship was swapped
      into relationship&mdash;Squire Blandford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight shade passed over Demorest's face. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, impatiently,
      &ldquo;I don't remember you; what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't remember me; that's likely,&rdquo; returned Ezekiel imperturbably,
      combing his straggling chin beard with three fingers, &ldquo;but whether it's
      NAT'RAL or not, considerin' the sukumstances when we last met, ez a matter
      of op-pinion. You got me to harness up the hoss and buggy the night Squire
      Blandford left home, and never was heard of again. It's true that it kem
      out on enquiry that the hoss and buggy ran away from the hotel, and that
      you had to go out to Warensboro in a sleigh, and the theory is that poor
      Squire Blandford must have stopped the hoss and buggy somewhere, got in
      and got run away agin, and pitched over the bridge. But seein' your
      relationship to both Squire and Mrs. Blandford, and all the sukumstances,
      I reckoned you'd remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard of it in Boston a month afterwards,&rdquo; said Demorest, dryly, &ldquo;but I
      don't think I'd have recognized you. So you were the hired man who gave me
      the buggy. Well, I don't suppose they discharged you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, with undisturbed equanimity. &ldquo;I kalkilate Joan would
      have stopped that. Considerin', too, that I knew her when she was Deacon
      Salisbury's darter, and our fam'lies waz thick az peas. She knew me well
      enough when I met her in Frisco the other day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mrs. Demorest already?&rdquo; said Demorest, with sudden
      vivacity. &ldquo;Why didn't you say so before?&rdquo; It was wonderful how quickly his
      face had lighted up with an earnestness that was not, however, without
      some undefinable uneasiness. The alert Ezekiel noticed it and observed
      that it was as totally unlike the irresistible dominance of the man of
      five years ago as it was different from the heavy abstraction of the man
      of five minutes before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you didn't ax me,&rdquo; he returned coolly. &ldquo;She told me where you
      were, and as I had business down this way she guessed I might drop in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;it's all right, Mr. Corwin; glad you did,&rdquo; said Demorest,
      kindly but half nervously. &ldquo;And you saw Mrs. Demorest? Where did you see
      her, and how did you think she was looking? As pretty as ever, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the coldly literal Ezekiel was not to be beguiled into polite or
      ambiguous fiction. He even went to the extent of insulting deliberation
      before he replied. &ldquo;I've seen Joan Salisbury lookin' healthier and ez far
      ez I kin judge doin' more credit to her stock and raisin' gin'rally,&rdquo; he
      said, thoughtfully combing his beard, &ldquo;and I've seen her when she was too
      poor to get the silks and satins, furbelows, fineries and vanities she's
      flauntin' in now, and that was in Squire Blandford's time, too, I reckon.
      Ez to her purtiness, that's a matter of taste. You think her purty, and I
      guess them fellows ez was escortin' and squirin' her round Frisco thought
      so too, or SHE thought they did to hev allowed it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not very merciful to your townsfolk, Mr. Corwin,&rdquo; said Demorest,
      with a forced smile; &ldquo;but what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the turn for Ezekiel's face to brighten, or rather to break up,
      like a cold passionless mirror suddenly cracked, into various amusing but
      distorted reflections on the person before him. &ldquo;Townies ain't to be
      fooled by other townies, Mr. Demorest; at least that ain't my idea o'
      marcy, he-he! But seen you're pressin', I don't mind tellen you MY
      business. I'm the only agent of Seventeen Patent Medicine Proprietors in
      Connecticut represented by the firm of Dilworth &amp; Dusenberry, of San
      Francisco. Mebbe you heard of 'em afore&mdash;A1 druggists and importers.
      Wa'al, I'm openin' a field for 'em and spreadin' 'em gin'rally through
      these air benighted and onhealthy districts, havin' the contract for the
      hull State&mdash;especially for Wozun's Universal Injin Panacea ez cures
      everything&mdash;bein' had from a recipe given by a Sachem to Dr. Wozun's
      gran'ther. That bag&mdash;leavin' out a dozen paper collars and socks&mdash;is
      all the rest samples. That's me, Ezekiel Corwin&mdash;only agent for
      Californy, and that's my mission.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; but look here, Corwin,&rdquo; said Demorest, with a slight return of
      his old off-hand manner,&mdash;&ldquo;I'd advise you to adopt a little more
      caution, and a little less criticism in your speech to the people about
      here, or I'm afraid you'll need the Universal Panacea for yourself. Better
      men than you have been shot in my presence for half your freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you've just hit the bull's-eye there,&rdquo; replied Ezekiel, coolly,
      &ldquo;for it's that HALF-freedom and HALF-truth that doesn't pay. I kalkilate
      gin'rally to speak my hull mind&mdash;and I DO. Wot's the consequence?
      Why, when folks find I ain't afeard to speak my mind on their affairs,
      they kinder guess I'm tellin' the truth about my own. Folks don't like the
      man that truckles to 'em, whether it's in the sellin' of a box of pills or
      a principle. When they re-cognize Ezekiel Corwin ain't goin' to lie about
      'em to curry favor with 'em, they're ready to believe he ain't goin' to
      lie about Jones' Bitters or Wozun's Panacea. And, wa'al, I've been on the
      road just about a fortnit, and I haven't yet discovered that the original
      independent style introduced by Ezekiel Corwin ever broke anybody's bones
      or didn't pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he told the truth. That remarkably unfair and unpleasant spoken man
      had actually frozen Hanley's Ford into icy astonishment at his audacity,
      and he had sold them an invoice of the Panacea before they had recovered;
      he had insulted Chipitas into giving an extensive order in bitters; he had
      left Hayward's Creek pledged to Burne's pills&mdash;with drawn revolvers
      still in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time Demorest might have been amused at his guest's audacity,
      or have combated it with his old imperiousness, but he only remained
      looking at him in a dull sort of way as if yielding to his influence. It
      was part of the phenomenon that the two men seemed to have changed
      character since they last met, and when Ezekiel said confidentially: &ldquo;I
      reckon you're goin' to show me what room I ken stow these duds o' mine
      in,&rdquo; Demorest replied hurriedly, &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; and taking up his
      guest's carpet-bag preceded him through the hall to one of the apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll send Manuel to you presently,&rdquo; he said, putting down the bag
      mechanically; &ldquo;the servants are not back from church, it's some saint's
      festival to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you keep a pack of lazy idolaters to leave your house to take care
      of itself, whilst they worship graven images,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, delighted at
      this opportunity to improve the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If my memory isn't bad, Mr. Corwin,&rdquo; said Demorest dryly, &ldquo;when I
      accompanied Mr. Blandford home the night he returned from his journey, we
      found YOU at church, and he had to put up his horse himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that was the Sabbath&mdash;the seventh day of the command,&rdquo; retorted
      Ezekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here the Sabbath doesn't consist of only ONE day to serve God in,&rdquo;
       said Demorest, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel glanced under his white lashes at Demorest's thoughtful face. His
      fondest fears appeared to be confirmed; Demorest had evidently become a
      Papist. But that gentleman stopped any theological discussion by the
      abrupt inquiry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Mrs. Demorest say when she thought of returning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She allowed she mout kem to-morrow&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; added Ezekiel
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, wot with her enjyments of the vanities of this life and the
      kempany she keeps, I reckon she's in no hurry,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of Manuel here cut short any response from Demorest, who
      after a few directions in Spanish to the peon, left his guest to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the veranda with the same dull preoccupation that Ezekiel had
      noticed as so different from his old decisive manner, and remained for a
      few moments abstractedly gazing into the dark garden. The strange and
      mystic shapes which had impressed even the practical Ezekiel, had become
      even more weird and ghost-like in the faint radiance of a rising moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      What memories evoked by his rude guest seemed to take form and outline in
      that dreamy and unreal expanse!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his wife again, standing as she had stood that night in her
      mother's house, with the white muffler around her head, and white face,
      imploring him to fly; he saw himself again hurrying through the driving
      storm to Warensboro, and reaching the train that bore him swiftly and
      safely miles away&mdash;that same night when her husband was perishing in
      the swollen river. He remembered with what strangely mingled sensations he
      had read the account of Blandford's death in the newspapers, and how the
      loss of his old friend was forgotten in the associations conjured up by
      his singular meeting that very night with the mysterious woman he had
      loved. He remembered that he had never dreamed how near and fateful were
      these associations; and how he had kept his promise not to seek her
      without her permission, until six months after, when she appointed a
      meeting, and revealed to him the whole truth. He could see her now, as he
      had seen her then, more beautiful and fascinating than ever in her black
      dress, and the pensive grace of refined suffering and restrained passion
      in her delicate face. He remembered, too, how the shock of her disclosure&mdash;the
      knowledge that she had been his old friend's wife&mdash;seemed only to
      accent her purity and suffering and his own wilful recklessness, and how
      it had stirred all the chivalry, generosity, and affection of his easy
      nature to take the whole responsibility of this innocent but compromising
      intrigue on his own shoulders. He had had no self-accusing sense of
      disloyalty to Blandford in his practical nature; he had never suspected
      the shy, proper girl of being his wife; he was willing to believe now,
      that had he known it, even that night, he would never have seen her again;
      he had been very foolish; he had made this poor woman participate in his
      folly; but he had never been dishonest or treacherous in thought or
      action. If Blandford had lived, even he would have admitted it. Yet he was
      guiltily conscious of a material satisfaction in Blandford's death,
      without his wife's religious conviction of the saving graces of
      predestination.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been married quietly when the two years of her widowhood had
      expired; his former relations with her husband and the straitened
      circumstances in which Blandford's death had left her having been deemed
      sufficient excuse in the eyes of North Liberty for her more worldly union.
      They had come to California at her suggestion &ldquo;to begin life anew,&rdquo; for
      she had not hesitated to make this dislocation of all her antecedent
      surroundings as a reason as well as a condition of this marriage. She
      wished to see the world of which he had been a passing glimpse; to expand
      under his protection beyond the limits of her fettered youth. He had
      bought this old Spanish estate, with its near vineyard and its outlying
      leagues covered with wild cattle, partly from that strange contradictory
      predilection for peaceful husbandry common to men who have led a roving
      life, and partly as a check to her growing and feverish desire for change
      and excitement. He had at first enjoyed with an almost parental affection
      her childish unsophisticated delight in that world he had already wearied
      of, and which he had been prepared to gladly resign for her. But as the
      months and even years had passed without any apparent diminution in her
      zest for these pleasures, he tried uneasily to resume his old interest in
      them, and spent ten months with her in the chaotic freedom of San
      Francisco hotel life. But to his discomfiture he found that they no longer
      diverted him; to his horror he discovered that those easy gallantries in
      which he had spent his youth, and in which he had seen no harm, were
      intolerable when exhibited to his wife, and he trembled between inquietude
      and indignation at the copies of his former self, whom he met in hotel
      parlors, at theatres, and in public conveyances. The next time she visited
      some friends in San Francisco he did not accompany her. Though he fondly
      cherished his experience of her power to resist even stronger temptation,
      he was too practical to subject himself to the annoyance of witnessing it.
      In her absence he trusted her completely; his scant imagination conjured
      up no disturbing picture of possibilities beyond what he actually knew. In
      his recent questions of Ezekiel he did not expect to learn anything more.
      Even his guest's uncomfortable comments added no sting that he had not
      already felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these thoughts called up by the unlooked-for advent of Ezekiel under
      his roof, he continued to gaze moodily into the garden. Near the house
      were scattered several uncouth varieties of cacti which seemed to have
      lost all semblance of vegetable growth, and had taken rude likeness to
      beasts and human figures. One high-shouldered specimen, partly hidden in
      the shadow, had the appearance of a man with a cloak or serape thrown over
      his left shoulder. As Demorest's wandering eyes at last became fixed upon
      it, he fancied he could trace the faint outlines of a pale face, the lower
      part of which was hidden by the folds of the serape. There certainly was
      the forehead, the curve of the dark eyebrows, the shadow of a nose, and
      even as he looked more steadily, a glistening of the eyes upturned to the
      moonlight. A sudden chill seized him. It was a horrible fancy, but it
      looked as might have looked the dead face of Edward Blandford! He started
      and ran quickly down the steps of the veranda. A slight wind at the same
      moment moved the long leaves and tendrils of a vine nearest him and sent a
      faint wave through the garden. He reached the cactus; its fantastic bulk
      stood plainly before him, but nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar are ye runnin' to?&rdquo; said the inquiring voice of Ezekiel from the
      veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I saw some one in the garden,&rdquo; returned Demorest, quietly,
      satisfied of the illusion of his senses, &ldquo;but it was a mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It mout and it moutn't,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, dryly. &ldquo;Thar's nothin' to keep any
      one out. It's only a wonder that you ain't overrun with thieves and sich
      like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are usually servants about the place,&rdquo; said Demorest, carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef they're the same breed ez that Manuel, I reckon I'd almost as leave
      take my chances in the road. Ef it's all the same to you I kalkilate to
      put a paytent fastener to my door and winder to-night. I allus travel with
      them.&rdquo; Seeing that Demorest only shrugged his shoulders without replying,
      he continued, &ldquo;Et ain't far from here that some folks allow is the
      headquarters of that cattle-stealing gang. The driver of the coach went ez
      far ez to say that some of these high and mighty Dons hereabouts knows
      more of it than they keer to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's simply a yarn for greenhorns,&rdquo; said Demorest, contemptuously. &ldquo;I
      know all the ranch proprietors for twenty leagues around, and they've lost
      as many cattle and horses as I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanter know,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, with grim interest. &ldquo;Then you've already
      had consid'ble losses, eh? I kalkilate them cattle are vally'ble&mdash;about
      wot figger do you reckon yer out and injured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three or four thousand dollars, I suppose, altogether,&rdquo; replied Demorest,
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't take any stock in them yer yarns about the gang being run
      and protected by some first-class men in Frisco?&rdquo; said Ezekiel,
      regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; responded Demorest, dryly; &ldquo;but if people choose to believe
      this bluff gotten up by the petty thieves themselves to increase their
      importance and secure their immunity&mdash;they can. But here's Manuel to
      tell us supper is ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He led the way to the corridor and courtyard which Ezekiel had not
      penetrated on account of its obscurity and solitude, but which now seemed
      to be peopled with peons and household servants of both sexes. At the end
      of a long low-ceilinged room a table was spread with omelettes, chupa,
      cakes, chocolate, grapes, and melons, around which half a dozen attendants
      stood gravely in waiting. The size of the room, which to Ezekiel's eyes
      looked as large as the church at North Liberty, the profusion of the
      viands, the six attendants for the host and solitary guest, deeply
      impressed him. Morally rebelling against this feudal display and
      extravagance, he, who had disdained to even assist the Blandfords'
      servant-in-waiting at table and had always made his solitary meal on the
      kitchen dresser, was not above feeling a material satisfaction in sitting
      on equal terms with his master's friend and being served by these menials
      he despised. He did full justice to the victuals of which Demorest partook
      in sparing abstraction, and particularly to the fruit, which Demorest did
      not touch at all. Observant of his servants' eyes fixed in wonder on the
      strange guest who had just disposed of a second melon at supper, Demorest
      could not help remarking that he would lose credit as a medico with the
      natives unless he restrained a public exhibition of his tastes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ez ha'aw?&rdquo; queried Ezekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have a proverb here that fruit is gold in the morning, silver at
      noon, and lead at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll do for lazy stomicks,&rdquo; said the unabashed Ezekiel. &ldquo;When they're
      once fortified by Jones' bitters and hard work, they'll be able to tackle
      the Lord's nat'ral gifts of the airth at any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Declining the cigarettes offered him by Demorest for a quid of tobacco,
      which he gravely took from a tin box in his pocket, and to the astonished
      eyes of the servants apparently obliterated any further remembrance of the
      meal, he accompanied his host to the veranda again, where, tilting his
      chair back and putting his feet on the railing, he gave himself up to
      unwonted and silent rumination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken at last by Demorest, who, half-reclining on a
      settee, had once or twice glanced towards the misshapen cactus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there any trace discovered of Blandford, other than we knew before we
      left the States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, no,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, thoughtfully. &ldquo;The last idea was that he'd got
      control of the hoss after passin' the bridge, and had managed to turn him
      back, for there was marks of buggy wheels on the snow on the far side, and
      that fearin' to trust the hoss or the bridge he tried to lead him over
      when the bridge gave way, and he was caught in the wreck and carried off
      down stream. That would account for his body not bein' found; they do tell
      that chunks of that bridge were picked up on the Sound beach near the
      mouth o' the river, nigh unto sixty miles away. That's about the last idea
      they had of it at North Liberty.&rdquo; He paused and then cleverly directing a
      stream of tobacco juice at an accurate curve over the railing, wiped his
      lips with the back of his hand, and added, slowly: &ldquo;Thar's another idea&mdash;but
      I reckon it's only mine. Leastways I ain't heard it argued by anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, it ain't exakly complimentary to E. Blandford, Esq., and it mout
      be orkard for YOU.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you're in the habit of letting such trifles interfere with
      your opinion,&rdquo; said Demorest, with a slightly forced laugh; &ldquo;but what is
      your idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That thar wasn't any accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No accident?&rdquo; replied Demorest, raising himself on his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nary accident,&rdquo; continued Ezekiel, deliberately, &ldquo;and, if it comes to
      that, not much of a dead body either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; said Demorest, sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, with momentous deliberation, &ldquo;that E. Blandford,
      of the Winnipeg Mills, was in March, '50, ez nigh bein' bust up ez any man
      kin be without actually failin'; that he'd been down to Boston that day to
      get some extensions; that old Deacon Salisbury knew it, and had been
      pesterin' Mrs. Blandford to induce him to sell out and leave the place;
      and that the night he left he took about two hundred and fifty dollars in
      bank bills that they allus kept in the house, and Mrs. Blandford was in
      the habit o' hidin' in the breast-pocket of one of his old overcoats
      hangin' up in the closet. I mean that that air money and that air overcoat
      went off with him, ez Mrs. Blandford knows, for I heard her tell her ma
      about it. And when his affairs were wound up and his debts paid, I reckon
      that the two hundred and fifty was all there was left&mdash;and he scooted
      with it. It's orkard for you&mdash;ez I said afore&mdash;but I don't see
      wot on earth you need get riled for. Ef he ran off on account of only two
      hundred and fifty dollars he ain't goin' to run back again for the mere
      matter o' your marrying Joan. Ef he had&mdash;he'd a done it afore this.
      It's orkard ez I said&mdash;but the only orkardness is your feelin's. I
      reckon Joan's got used to hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Demorest had risen angrily to his feet. But the next moment the utter
      impossibility of reaching this man's hidebound moral perception by even
      physical force hopelessly overcame him. It would only impress him with the
      effect of his own disturbing power, that to Ezekiel was equal to a proof
      of the truth of his opinions. It might even encourage him to repeat this
      absurd story elsewhere with his own construction upon his reception of it.
      After all it was only Ezekiel's opinion&mdash;an opinion too preposterous
      for even a moment's serious consideration. Blandford alive, and a petty
      defaulter! Blandford above the earth and complacently abandoning his wife
      and home to another! Blandford&mdash;perhaps a sneaking, cowardly Nemesis&mdash;hiding
      in the shadow for future&mdash;impossible! It really was enough to make
      him laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did laugh, albeit with an uneasy sense that only a few years ago he
      would have struck down the man who had thus traduced his friend's memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been overtaxing your brain in patent-medicine circulars, Corwin,&rdquo;
       he said in a roughly rallying manner, &ldquo;and you've got rather too much
      highfalutin and bitters mixed with your opinions. After that yarn of yours
      you must be dry. What'll you take? I haven't got any New England rum, but
      I can give you some ten-year-old aguardiente made on the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he lifted a decanter and glass from a small table which Manuel
      had placed in the veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; said Ezekiel dryly. &ldquo;It's now goin' on five years since
      I've been a consistent temperance man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In everything but melons, and criticism of your neighbor, eh?&rdquo; said
      Demorest, pouring out a glass of the liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev my convictions,&rdquo; said Ezekiel with affected meekness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I have mine,&rdquo; said Demorest, tossing off the fiery liquor at a draft,
      &ldquo;and it's that this is devilish good stuff. Sorry you can't take some. I'm
      afraid I'll have to get you to excuse me for a while. I have to take a
      ride over the ranch before turning in, to see if everything's right. The
      house is 'at your disposition,' as we say here. I'll see you later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away with a slight exaggeration of unconcern. Ezekiel watched
      him narrowly with colorless eyes beneath his white lashes. When he had
      gone he examined the thoroughly emptied glass of aguardiente, and, taking
      the decanter, sniffed critically at its sharp and potent contents. A smile
      of gratified discernment followed. It was clear to him that Demorest was a
      heavy drinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to his prognostication, however, Mrs. Demorest DID arrive the
      next day. But although he was to depart from Buenaventura by the same
      coach that had set her down at the gate of the casa, he had already left
      the house armed with some letters of introduction which Demorest had
      generously given him, to certain small traders in the pueblo and along the
      route. Demorest was not displeased to part with him before the arrival of
      his wife, and thus spare her the awkwardness of a repetition of Ezekiel's
      effrontery in her presence. Nor was he willing to have the impediment of a
      guest in the house to any explanation he might have to seek from her, or
      to the confidences that hereafter must be fuller and more mutual. For with
      all his deep affection for his wife, Richard Demorest unconsciously feared
      her. The strong man whose dominance over men and women alike had been his
      salient characteristic, had begun to feel an undefinable sense of some
      unrecognized quality in the woman he loved. He had once or twice detected
      it in a tone of her voice, in a remembered and perhaps even once idolized
      gesture, or in the accidental lapse of some bewildering word. With the
      generosity of a large nature he had put the thought aside, referring it to
      some selfish weakness of his own, or&mdash;more fatuous than all&mdash;to
      a possible diminution of his own affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing on the steps ready to receive her. Few of her appreciative
      sex could have remained indifferent to the tender and touching
      significance of his silent and subdued welcome. He had that piteous
      wistfulness of eye seen in some dogs and the husbands of many charming
      women&mdash;the affection that pardons beforehand the indifference it has
      learned to expect. She approached him smiling in her turn, meeting the
      sublime patience of being unloved with the equally resigned patience of
      being loved, and feeling that comforting sense of virtue which might
      become a bore, but never a self-reproach. For the rest, she was prettier
      than ever; her five years of expanded life had slightly rounded the
      elongated oval of her face, filled up the ascetic hollows of her temples,
      and freed the repression of her mouth and chin. A more genial climate had
      quickened the circulation that North Liberty had arrested, and suffused
      the transparent beauty of her skin with eloquent life. It seemed as if the
      long, protracted northern spring of her youth had suddenly burst into a
      summer of womanhood under those gentle skies; and yet enough of her
      puritan precision of manner, movement, and gesture remained to temper her
      fuller and more exuberant life and give it repose. In a community of
      pretty women more or less given to the license and extravagance of the
      epoch, she always looked like a lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her in his arms and half-lifted her up the last step of the
      veranda. She resisted slightly with her characteristic action of catching
      his wrists in both her hands and holding him off with an awkward primness,
      and almost in the same tone that she had used to Edward Blandford five
      years before, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Dick, that will do.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <p>
      Demorest's dream of a few days' conjugal seclusion and confidences with
      his wife was quickly dispelled by that lady. &ldquo;I came down with Rosita
      Pico, whose father, you know, once owned this property,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She's
      gone on to her cousins at Los Osos Rancho to-night, but comes here
      to-morrow for a visit. She knows the place well; in fact, she once had a
      romantic love affair here. But she is very entertaining. It will be a
      little change for us,&rdquo; she added, naively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demorest kept back a sigh, without changing his gentle smile. &ldquo;I'm glad
      for your sake, dear. But is she not a little flighty and inclined to flirt
      a good deal? I think I've heard so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a young girl who has been severely tried, Richard, and perhaps is
      not to blame for endeavoring to forget it in such distraction as she can
      find,&rdquo; said Mrs. Demorest, with a slight return of her old manner. &ldquo;I can
      understand her feelings perfectly.&rdquo; She looked pointedly at her husband as
      she spoke, it being one of her late habits to openly refer to their
      ante-nuptial acquaintance as a natural reaction from the martyrdom of her
      first marriage, with a quiet indifference that seemed almost an
      indelicacy. But her husband only said: &ldquo;As you like, dear,&rdquo; vaguely
      remembering Dona Rosita as the alleged heroine of a forgotten romance with
      some earlier American adventurer who had disappeared, and trying vainly to
      reconcile his wife's sentimental description of her with his own
      recollection of the buxom, pretty, laughing, but dangerous-eyed Spanish
      girl he had, however, seen but once.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived the next day, flying into a protracted embrace of Joan, which
      included a smiling recognition of Demorest with an unoccupied blue eye,
      and a shake of her fan over his wife's shoulder. Then she drew back and
      seemed to take in the whole veranda and garden in another long caress of
      her eyes. &ldquo;Ah-yess! I have recognized it, mooch. It es ze same. Of no
      change&mdash;not even of a leetle. No, she ess always&mdash;esso.&rdquo; She
      stopped, looked unutterable things at Joan, pressed her fan below a spray
      of roses on her full bodice as if to indicate some thrilling memory
      beneath it, shook her head again, suddenly caught sight of Demorest's
      serious face, said: &ldquo;Ah, that brigand of our husband laughs himself at
      me,&rdquo; and then herself broke into a charming ripple of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was not laughing, Dona Rosita,&rdquo; said Demorest, smiling sadly,
      however, in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a little grimace, and then raised her elbows, slightly lifting
      her shoulders. &ldquo;As it shall please you, Senor. But he is gone&mdash;thees
      passion. Yess&mdash;what you shall call thees sentiment of lof&mdash;zo&mdash;as
      he came!&rdquo; She threw her fingers in the air as if to illustrate the
      volatile and transitory passage of her affections, and then turned again
      to Joan with her back towards Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do please go on&mdash;Dona Rosita,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I never heard the real
      story. If there is any romance about my house, I'd like to know it,&rdquo; he
      added with a faint sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dona Rosita wheeled upon him with an inquiring little look. &ldquo;Ah, you have
      the sentiment, and YOU,&rdquo; she continued, taking Joan by the arms, &ldquo;YOU have
      not. Eet ess good so. When a&mdash;the wife,&rdquo; she continued boldly,
      hazarding an extended English abstraction, &ldquo;he has the sentimente and the
      hoosband he has nothing, eet is not good&mdash;for a-him&mdash;ze wife,&rdquo;
       she concluded triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have great appreciation and I am dying to hear it,&rdquo; said Demorest,
      trying to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, poor one, you look so. But you shall lif till another time,&rdquo; said
      Dona Rosita, with a mock courtesy, gliding with Joan away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;other time&rdquo; came that evening when chocolate was served on the
      veranda, where Dona Rosita, mantilla-draped against the dry, clear,
      moonlit air, sat at the feet of Joan on the lowest step. Demorest,
      uneasily observant of the influence of the giddy foreigner on his wife,
      and conscious of certain confidences between them from which he was
      excluded, leaned against a pillar of the porch in half abstracted
      resignation; Joan, under the tutelage of Rosita, lit a cigarette; Demorest
      gazed at her wonderingly, trying to recall, in her fuller and more
      animated face, some memory of the pale, refined profile of the Puritan
      girl he had first met in the Boston train, the faint aurora of whose cheek
      in that northern clime seemed to come and go with his words. Becoming
      conscious at last of the eyes of Dona Rosita watching him from below, with
      an effort he recalled his duty as her host and gallantly reminded her that
      moonlight and the hour seemed expressly fitted for her promised love
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do tell it,&rdquo; said Joan, &ldquo;I don't mind hearing it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know it already?&rdquo; said Demorest, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan took the cigarette from her lips, laughed complacently, and exchanged
      a familiar glance with Rosita. &ldquo;She told it me a year ago, when we first
      knew each other,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Go on, dear,&rdquo; to Rosita.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, Dona Rosita began, addressing herself first in Spanish to
      Demorest, who understood the language better than his wife, and lapsing
      into her characteristic English as she appealed to them both. It was
      really very little to interest Don Ricardo&mdash;this story of a silly
      muchacha like herself and a strange caballero. He would go to sleep while
      she was talking, and to-night he would say to his wife, &ldquo;Mother of God!
      why have you brought here this chattering parrot who speaks but of one
      thing?&rdquo; But she would go on always like the windmill, whether there was
      grain to grind or no. &ldquo;It was four years ago. Ah! Don Ricardo did not
      remember the country then&mdash;it was when the first Americans came&mdash;now
      it is different. Then there were no coaches&mdash;in truth one travelled
      very little, and always on horseback, only to see one's neighbors. And
      suddenly, as if in one day, it was changed; there were strange men on the
      roads, and one was frightened, and one shut the gates of the pateo and
      drove the horses into the corral. One did not know much of the Americans
      then&mdash;for why? They were always going, going&mdash;never stopping,
      hurrying on to the gold mines, hurrying away from the gold mines, hurrying
      to look for other gold mines: but always going on foot, on horseback, in
      queer wagons&mdash;hurrying, pushing everywhere. Ah, it took away the
      breath. All, except one American&mdash;he did not hurry, he did not go
      with the others, he came and stayed here at Buenaventura. He was very
      quiet, very civil, very sad, and very discreet. He was not like the
      others, and always kept aloof from them. He came to see Don Andreas Pico,
      and wanted to beg a piece of land and an old vaquero's hut near the road
      for a trifle. Don Andreas would have given it, or a better house, to him,
      or have had him live at the casa here; but he would not. He was very proud
      and shy, so he took the vaquero's hut, a mere adobe affair, and lived in
      it, though a caballero like yourself, with white hands that knew not
      labor, and small feet that had seldom walked. In good time he learned to
      ride like the best vaquero, and helped Don Andreas to find the lost
      mustangs, and showed him how to improve the old mill. And his pride and
      his shyness wore off, and he would come to the casa sometimes. And Don
      Andreas got to love him very much, and his daughter, Dona Rosita&mdash;ah,
      well, yes truly&mdash;a leetle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he had strange moods and ways, this American, and at times they would
      have thought him a lunatico had they not believed it to be an American
      fashion. He would be very kind and gentle like one of the family, coming
      to the casa every day, playing with the children, advising Don Andreas and&mdash;yes&mdash;having
      a devotion&mdash;very discreet, very ceremonious, for Dona Rosita. And
      then, all in a moment, he would become as ill, without a word or gesture,
      until he would stalk out of the house, gallop away furiously, and for a
      week not be heard of. The first time it happened, Dona Rosita was piqued
      by his rudeness, Don Andreas was alarmed, for it was on an evening like
      the present, and Dona Rosita was teaching him a little song on the guitar
      when the fit came on him. And he snapped the guitar strings like thread
      and threw it down, and got up like a bear and walked away without a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it all,&rdquo; said Demorest, half seriously: &ldquo;you were coquetting with
      him, and he was jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dona Rosita shook her head and turned impetuously, and said in English
      to Joan:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was astutcia&mdash;a trick, a ruse. Because when my father have
      arrived at his house, he is agone. And so every time. When he have the fit
      he goes not to his house. No. And it ees not until after one time when he
      comes back never again, that we have comprehend what he do at these times.
      And what do you think? I shall tell to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She composed herself comfortably, with her plump elbows on her knees, and
      her fan crossed on the palm of her hand before her, and began again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a year he has gone, and the stagecoach is attack of brigands.
      Tiburcio, our vaquero, have that night made himself a pasear on the road,
      and he have seen HIM. He have seen, one, two, three men came from the wood
      with something on the face, and HE is of them. He has nothing on his face,
      and Tiburcio have recognize him. We have laugh at Tiburcio. We believe him
      not. It is improbable that this Senor Huanson&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Senor who?&rdquo; said Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huanson&mdash;eet is the name of him. Ah, Carr!&mdash;posiblemente it is
      nothing&mdash;a Don Fulano&mdash;or an apodo&mdash;Huanson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see, JOHNSON, very likely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have said it is not possible that this good man, who have come to the
      house and ride on his back the children, is a thief and a brigand. And one
      night my father have come from the Monterey in the coach, and it was
      stopped. And the brigands have take from the passengers the money, the
      rings from the finger, and the watch&mdash;and my father was of the same.
      And my father, he have great dissatisfaction and anguish, for his watch is
      given to him of an old friend, and it is not like the other watch. But the
      watch he go all the same. And then when the robbers have made a finish
      comes to the window of the coach a mascara and have say, 'Who is the Don
      Andreas Pico?' And my father have say, 'It is I who am Don Andreas Pico.'
      And the mask have say, 'Behold, your watch is restore!' and he gif it to
      him. And my father say, 'To whom have I the distinguished honor to thank?'
      And the mask say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson,&rdquo; interrupted Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dona Rosita in grave triumph, &ldquo;he say Essmith. For this Essmith
      is like Huanson&mdash;an apodo&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you really think this man was your old friend?&rdquo; asked Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that he was a robber even when living here&mdash;and that it was not
      your cruelty that really drove him to take the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dona Rosita shrugged her plump shoulders. &ldquo;You will not comprehend. It was
      because of his being a brigand that he stayed not with us. My father would
      not have object if he have present himself to me for marriage in these
      times. I would not have object, for I was young, and we have knew nothing.
      It was he who have object. For why? Inside of his heart he have feel he
      was a brigand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you might have reformed him in time,&rdquo; said Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She again shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Quien sabe.&rdquo; After a pause she added
      with infinite gravity: &ldquo;And before he have reform, it is bad for the
      menage. I should invite to my house some friend. They arrive, and one say,
      'I have not the watch of my pocket,' and another, 'The ring of my finger,
      he is gone,' and another, 'My earrings, she is loss.' And I am obliged to
      say, 'They reside now in the pocket of my hoosband; patience! a little
      while&mdash;perhaps to-morrow&mdash;he will restore.' No,&rdquo; she continued,
      with an air of infinite conviction, &ldquo;it is not good for the menage&mdash;the
      necessity of those explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me he was handsome,&rdquo; said Joan, passing her arm carelessly
      around Dona Rosita's comfortable waist. &ldquo;How did he look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As an angel! He have long curls to his back. His moustache was as silk,
      for he have had never a barber to his face. And his eyes&mdash;Santa
      Maria!&mdash;so soft and so&mdash;so melankoly. When he smile it is like
      the moonlight. But,&rdquo; she added, rising to her feet and tossing the end of
      her lace mantilla over her shoulder with a little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;it is
      finish&mdash;Adelante! Dr-rrive on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to destroy your belief in the connection of your friend with
      the road agents,&rdquo; said Demorest grimly, &ldquo;but if he belongs to their band
      it is in an inferior capacity. Most of them are known to the authorities,
      and I have heard it even said that their leader or organizer is a very
      unromantic speculator in San Francisco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But this suggestion was received coldly by the ladies, who superciliously
      turned their backs upon it and the suggester. Joan dropped her voice to a
      lower tone and turned to Dona Rosita. &ldquo;And you have never seen him since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should&mdash;at least, I wouldn't have let it end in THAT way,&rdquo; said
      Joan in a positive whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Dona Rosita, laughing. &ldquo;So eet is YOU, Juanita, that have the
      romance&mdash;eh? Ah, bueno! 'you have the house&mdash;so I gif to you the
      lover also.' I place him at your disposition.&rdquo; She made a mock gesture of
      elaborate and complete abnegation. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she added in Joan's ear, with a
      quick glance at Demorest, &ldquo;do not let our hoosband eat him. Even now he
      have the look to strangle ME. Make to him a little lof, quickly, when I
      shall walk in the garden.&rdquo; She turned away with a pretty wave of her fan
      to Demorest, and calling out, &ldquo;I go to make an assignation with my
      memory,&rdquo; laughed again, and lazily passed into the shadow. An ominous
      silence on the veranda followed, broken finally by Mrs. Demorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think it was necessary for you to show your dislike to Dona
      Rosita quite so plainly,&rdquo; she said, coldly, slightly accenting the Puritan
      stiffness, which any conjugal tete-a-tete lately revived in her manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I show dislike of Dona Rosita?&rdquo; stammered Demorest, in surprise. &ldquo;Come,
      Joan,&rdquo; he added, with a forgiving smile, &ldquo;you don't mean to imply that I
      dislike her because I couldn't get up a thrilling interest in an old story
      I've heard from every gossip in the pueblo since I can remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not an old story to HER,&rdquo; said Joan, dryly, &ldquo;and even if it were,
      you might reflect that all people are not as anxious to forget the past as
      you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Demorest drew back to let the shaft glance by. &ldquo;The story is old enough,
      at least for her to have had a dozen flirtations, as you know, since
      then,&rdquo; he returned gently, &ldquo;and I don't think she herself seriously
      believes in it. But let that pass. I am sorry I offended her. I had no
      idea of doing so. As a rule, I think she is not so easily offended. But I
      shall apologize to her.&rdquo; He stopped and approached nearer his wife in a
      half-timid, half-tentative affection. &ldquo;As to my forgetfulness of the past,
      Joan, even if it were true, I have had little cause to forget it lately.
      Your friend, Corwin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must insist upon your not calling him MY friend, Richard,&rdquo; interrupted
      Joan, sharply, &ldquo;considering that it was through YOUR indiscretion in
      coming to us for the buggy that night, that he suspected&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped suddenly, for at that moment a startled little shriek, quickly
      subdued, rang through the garden. Demorest ran hurriedly down the steps in
      the direction of the outcry. Joan followed more cautiously. At the first
      turning of the path Dona Rosita almost fell into his arms. She was
      breathless and trembling, but broke into a hysterical laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have such a fear come to me&mdash;I cry out! I think I have seen a man;
      but it was nothing&mdash;nothing! I am a fool. It is no one here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where did you see anything?&rdquo; said Joan, coming up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosita flew to her side. &ldquo;Where? Oh, here!&mdash;everywhere! Ah, I am a
      fool!&rdquo; She was laughing now, albeit there were tears glistening on her
      lashes when she laid her head on Joan's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was some fancy&mdash;some resemblance you saw in that queer cactus,&rdquo;
       said Demorest, gently. &ldquo;It is quite natural, I was myself deceived the
      other night. But I'll look around to satisfy you. Take Dona Rosita back to
      the veranda, Joan. But don't be alarmed, dear&mdash;it was only an
      illusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away. When his figure was lost in the entwining foliage, Dona
      Rosita seized Joan's shoulder and dragged her face down to a level with
      her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was something!&rdquo; she whispered quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;HIM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; groaned Joan, nevertheless casting a hurried glance around
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said Dona Rosita quickly, &ldquo;he is gone&mdash;I saw him pass
      away&mdash;so! But it was HE&mdash;Huanson. I recognize him. I forget him
      never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I the eyes? the memory? Madre de Dios! Am I a lunatico too? Look! He
      have stood there&mdash;so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you think he knew you were here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quien sabe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that he came here to see you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dona Rosita caught her again by the shoulders, and with her lips to Joan's
      ear, said with the intensest and most deliberate of emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;NO!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in Heaven's name brought him here then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You! you! YOU!&rdquo; repeated Dona Rosita, with crescendo energy. &ldquo;I have come
      upon him here; where he stood and look at the veranda, absorrrb of YOU.
      You move&mdash;he fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! I have said I give him to you. And he came, Bueno,&rdquo; murmured
      Dona Rosita, with a half-resigned, half-superstitious gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WILL you be quiet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the sound of Demorest's feet on the gravel path, returning from his
      fruitless search. He had seen nothing. It must have been Dona Rosita's
      fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was just saying she thought she had been mistaken,&rdquo; said Joan,
      quietly. &ldquo;Let us go in&mdash;it is rather chilly here, and I begin to feel
      creepy too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, as they entered the house again, and the light of the hall
      lantern fell upon her face, Demorest thought he had never but once before
      seen her look so nervously and animatedly beautiful.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day, when Mr. Ezekiel Corwin had delivered his letters of
      introduction, and thoroughly canvassed the scant mercantile community of
      San Buenaventura with considerable success, he deposited his carpet-bag at
      the stage office in the posada, and found to his chagrin that he had still
      two hours to wait before the coach arrived. After a vain attempt to impart
      cheerful but disparaging criticism of the pueblo and its people to Senor
      Mateo and his wife&mdash;whose external courtesy had been visibly
      increased by a line from Demorest, but whose confidence towards the
      stranger had not been extended in the same proportion&mdash;he gave it up,
      and threw himself lazily on a wooden bench in the veranda, already hacked
      with the initials of his countrymen, and drawing a jack-knife from his
      pocket, he began to add to that emblazonry the trade-mark of the Panacea&mdash;as
      a casual advertisement. During its progress, however, he was struck by the
      fact that while no one seemed to enter the posada through the stage
      office, the number of voices in the adjoining room seemed to increase, and
      the ministrations of Mateo and his wife became more feverishly occupied
      with their invisible guests. It seemed to Ezekiel that consequently there
      must be a second entrance which he had not seen, and this added to the
      circumstance that one or two lounging figures who had been approaching
      unaccountably disappeared before reaching the veranda, induced him to rise
      and examine the locality. A few paces beyond was an alley, but it appeared
      to be already blocked by several cigarette-smoking, short-jacketed men who
      were leaning against its walls, and showed no inclination to make way for
      him. Checked, but not daunted, Ezekiel coolly returned to the stage
      office, and taking the first opportunity when Mateo passed through the
      rear door, followed him. As he expected, the innkeeper turned to the left
      and entered a large room filled with tobacco smoke and the local habitues
      of the posada. But Ezekiel, shrewdly surmising that the private entrance
      must be in the opposite direction, turned to the right along the passage
      until he came unexpectedly upon the corridor of the usual courtyard, or
      patio, of every Mexican hostelry, closed at one end by a low adobe wall,
      in which there was a door. The free passage around the corridor was
      interrupted by wide partitions, fitted up with tables and benches, like
      stalls, opening upon the courtyard where a few stunted fig and orange
      trees still grew. As the courtyard seemed to be the only communication
      between the passage he had left and the door in the wall, he was about to
      cross it, when the voices of two men in the compartment struck his ears.
      Although one was evidently an American's, Ezekiel was instinctively
      convinced that they were speaking in English only for greater security
      against being understood by the frequenters of the posada. It is
      unnecessary to say that this was an innocent challenge to the curiosity of
      Ezekiel that he instantly accepted. He drew back carefully into the shadow
      of the partition as one of the voices asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't that Johnson just come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement as if some one had risen to look over the
      compartment, but the gathering twilight completely hid Ezekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's late. Suppose he don't come&mdash;or back out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other man broke into a grim laugh. &ldquo;I reckon you don't know Johnson
      yet, or you'd understand this yer little game o' his is just the one idea
      o' his life. He's been two years on that man's track, and he ain't goin'
      to back out now that he's got a dead sure thing on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why is he so keen about it, anyway? It don't seem nat'ral for a
      business man built after Johnson's style, and a rich man to boot, to go
      into this detective business. It ain't the reward, we know that. Is it an
      old grudge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; The speaker paused, and then in a lower voice, which taxed
      Ezekial's keen ear to the uttermost, resumed: &ldquo;It's said up in Frisco that
      Cherokee Bob knew suthin' agin Johnson way back in the States; anyhow, I
      believe it's understood that they came across the plains together in '50&mdash;and
      Bob hounded Johnson and blackmailed him here where he was livin', even to
      the point of makin' him help him on the road or give information, until
      one day Johnson bucked against it&mdash;kicked over the traces&mdash;and
      swore he'd be revenged on Bob, and then just settled himself down to that
      business. Wotever he'd been and done himself he made it all right with the
      sheriff here; and I've heard ez it wasn't anything criminal or that sort,
      but that it was o' some private trouble that he'd confided to that hound
      Bob, and Bob had threatened to tell agen him. That's the grudge they say
      Johnson has, and that's why he's allowed to be the head devil in this yer
      affair. It's an understood thing, too, that the sheriff and the police
      ain't goin' to interfere if Johnson accidentally blows the top of Bob's
      head off in the scrimmage of a capter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I reckon Bob wouldn't hesitate to do the same thing to him when he
      finds out that Johnson has given him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said the other, sententiously, &ldquo;for it's Johnson's knowledge
      of the country and the hoss-stealers that are in with Bob's gang of road
      agents that made it easy for him to buy up and win over Bob's friends
      here, so that they'd help to trap him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pretty rough on Bob to be sold out in that way,&rdquo; said the second
      speaker, sympathizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they were white men, p'rhaps,&rdquo; returned his companion, contemptuously,
      &ldquo;but this yer's a case of Injin agen Injin, ez the men are Mexican
      half-breeds just as Bob's a half Cherokee. The sooner that kind o' cross
      cattle exterminate each other the better it'll be for the country. It
      takes a white man like Johnson to set 'em by the ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Ezekiel, beginning to be slightly bored with his
      cheaply acquired but rather impractical information, was about to slip
      back into the passage again when he was arrested by a laugh from the first
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; growled the other. &ldquo;Do you want to bring the whole
      posada out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only thinkin' what a skeer them innocent greenhorn passengers will
      get just ez they're snoozing off for the night, ten miles from here,&rdquo;
       responded his friend, with a chuckle. &ldquo;Wonder ef anybody's goin' up from
      here besides that patent medicine softy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel stopped as if petrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef the &mdash;&mdash; fools keep quiet they won't be hurt, for our men
      will be ready to chip in the moment of the attack. But we've got to let
      the attack be made for the sake of the evidence. And if we warn off the
      passengers from going this trip, and let the stage go up empty, Bob would
      suspect something and vamose. But here's Johnson!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door in the adobe wall had suddenly opened, and a figure in a serape
      entered the patio. Ezekiel, whose curiosity was whetted with indignation
      at the ignominious part assigned to him in this comedy, forgot even his
      risk of detection by the newcomer, who advanced quickly towards the
      compartment. When he had reached it he said, in a tone of bitterness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The game is up, gentlemen, and the whole thing is blown. The scoundrel
      has got some confederate here&mdash;for he's been seen openly on the road
      near Demorest's ranch, and the band have had warning and dispersed. We
      must find out the traitor, and take our precautions for the next time. Who
      is that there? I don't know him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was pointing to Ezekiel, who had started eagerly forward at the first
      sound of his voice. The two occupants of the compartment rose at the same
      moment, leaped into the courtyard, and confronted Ezekiel. Surrounded by
      the three menacing figures he did not quail, but remained intently gazing
      upon the newcomer. Then his mouth opened, and he drawled lazily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, ef it ain't Squire Blandford, of North Liberty, Connecticut, I'm a
      treed coon. Squire Blandford, how DO you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger drew back in undisguised amazement; the two men glanced
      hurriedly at each other; Ezekiel alone remained cool, smiling,
      imperturbable, and triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are YOU, sir? I do not know you,&rdquo; demanded the newcomer, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like ez not,&rdquo; said Corwin dryly, &ldquo;it's a matter o' four year sense I
      lived in your house. Even Dick Demorest&mdash;you knew Dick?&mdash;didn't
      know me; but I reckon that Mrs. Blandford as used to be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's enough,&rdquo; said Blandford&mdash;for it was he&mdash;suddenly
      mastering both himself and Corwin by a supreme emphasis of will and
      gesture. &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Then turning to the two others who were discreetly
      regarding the blank adobe wall before them, he said: &ldquo;Excuse me for a few
      minutes, gentlemen. There is no hurry now. I will see you later;&rdquo; and with
      an imperative wave of his hand motioned Ezekiel to precede him into the
      passage, and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak until they entered the stage office, when, passing
      through it, he said peremptorily: &ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo; The few loungers, who
      seemed to recognize him, made way for him with a singular deference that
      impressed Ezekiel, already dominated by his manner. The first perception
      in his mind was that Blandford had in some strange way succeeded to
      Demorest's former imperious character. There was no trace left of the old,
      gentle subjection to Joan's prim precision. Ezekiel followed him out of
      the office as unresistingly as he had followed Demorest into the stables
      on that eventful night. They passed down the narrow street until Blandford
      suddenly stopped short and turned into the crumbling doorway of one of the
      low adobe buildings and entered an apartment. It seemed to be the ordinary
      living-room of the house, made more domestic by the presence of a silk
      counterpaned bed in one corner, a prie Dieu and crucifix, and one or two
      articles of bedchamber furniture. A woman was sitting in deshabille by the
      window; a man was smoking on a lounge against the wall. Blandford, in the
      same peremptory manner, addressed a command in Spanish to the inmates, who
      immediately abandoned the apartment to the seeming trespasser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motioning his companion to a seat on the lounge just vacated, Blandford
      folded his arms and stood erect before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, with quick, business conciseness, &ldquo;what do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel was staggered out of his complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;I only reckoned to ask the news, ez we are old
      friends&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; repeated Blandford, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel was mystified, yet expectant. &ldquo;I can't say ez I exakly
      understand,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;much&mdash;money&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;want,&rdquo; continued
      Blandford, with frigid accuracy, &ldquo;to get up and get out of this place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, consideren ez I'm travellin' here ez the only authorized agent of
      a first-class Frisco Drug House,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, with a mingling of
      mortification, pride, and hopefulness, &ldquo;unless you're travellin' in the
      opposition business, I don't see what's that to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford regarded him searchingly for an instant. &ldquo;Who sent you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dilworth &amp; Dusenberry, Battery Street, San Francisco. Hev their
      card?&rdquo; said Ezekiel, taking one from his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Corwin,&rdquo; said Blandford, sternly, &ldquo;whatever your business is here you'll
      find it will pay you better, a &mdash;&mdash; sight, to be frank with me
      and stop this Yankee shuffling. You say you have been with Demorest&mdash;what
      has HE got to do with your business here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothin',&rdquo; said Ezekiel. &ldquo;I reckon he wos ez astonished to see me ez you
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn't he send you here to seek me?&rdquo; said Blandford, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considerin' he believes you a dead man, I reckon not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford gave a hard, constrained laugh. After a pause, still keeping his
      eyes fixed on Ezekiel, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your recognition of me was accidental?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, yes. And ez I never took much stock in the stories that you were
      washed off the Warensboro Bridge, I ain't much astonished at finding you
      agin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you believe happened to me?&rdquo; said Blandford, less brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel noticed the softening; he felt his own turn coming. &ldquo;I kalkilated
      you had reasons for going off, leaving no address behind you,&rdquo; he drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reasons?&rdquo; asked Blandford, with a sudden relapse of his former
      harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, Squire Blandford, sens you wanter know&mdash;I reckon your
      business wasn't payin', and there was a matter of two hundred and fifty
      dollars ye took with ye, that your creditors would hev liked to hev back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dare say that?&rdquo; demanded Blandford, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your wife that was&mdash;Mrs. Demorest ez is&mdash;told it to her
      mother,&rdquo; returned Ezekiel, lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blow struck deeper than even Ezekiel's dry malice imagined. For an
      instant, Blandford remained stupefied. In the five years' retrospect of
      his resolution on that fatal night, whatever doubt of its wisdom might
      have obtruded itself upon him, he had never thought of THIS. He had been
      willing to believe that his wife had quietly forgotten him as well as her
      treachery to him, he had passively acquiesced in the results of that
      forgetfulness and his own silence; he had been conscious that his wound
      had healed sooner than he expected, but if this consciousness had enabled
      him to extend a certain passive forgiveness to his wife and Demorest, it
      was always with the conviction that his mysterious effacement had left an
      inexplicable shadow upon them which their consciences alone could explain.
      But for this unjust, vulgar, and degrading interpretation of his own act
      of expiation, he was totally unprepared. It completely crushed whatever
      sentiment remained of that act in the horrible irony of finding himself
      put upon his defence before the world, without being able now to offer the
      real cause. The anguish of that night had gone forever; but the ridiculous
      interpretation of it had survived, and would survive it. In the eyes of
      the man before him he was not a wronged husband, but an absconding petty
      defaulter, whom he had just detected!
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was quickly made up. In that instant he had resolved upon a step
      as fateful as his former one, and a fitting climax to its results. For
      five years he had clearly misunderstood his attitude towards his
      treacherous wife and perjured friend. Thanks to this practical, selfish
      machine before him, he knew it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Corwin,&rdquo; he said, turning upon Ezekiel a colorless face, but a
      steady, merciless eye. &ldquo;I can guess, without your telling me, what lies
      may be circulated about me by the man and woman who know that I have only
      to declare myself alive to convict them of infamy&mdash;perhaps even of
      criminality before the law. You are not MY friend, or you would not have
      believed them; if you are THEIRS, you have two courses open to you now.
      Keep this meeting to yourself and trust to my mercy to keep it a secret
      also; or, tell Mrs. Demorest that you have seen Mr. Johnson, who is not
      afraid to come forward at any moment and proclaim that he is Edward
      Blandford, her only lawful husband. Choose which course you like&mdash;it
      is nothing more to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I reckon that, as far as I know Mrs. Demorest,&rdquo; said Ezekiel,
      dryly, &ldquo;it don't make the least difference to her either; but if you want
      to know my opinion o' this matter, it is that neither you nor Demorest
      exactly understand that woman. I've known Joan Salisbury since she was so
      high, but if ye expected me to tell you wot she was goin' to do next, I'd
      be able to tell ye where the next flash o' lightnin' would strike. It's
      wot you don't expect of Joan Salisbury that she does. And the best proof
      of it is that she filed papers for a divorce agin you in Chicago and got
      it by default a few weeks afore she married Demorest&mdash;and you don't
      know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blandford recoiled. &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; he said, but his voice too plainly
      showed how clearly its possibility struck him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's so, but it was kept secret by Deacon Salisbury. I overheerd it.
      Wa'al, that's a proof that you don't understand Joan, I reckon. And
      considerin' that Demorest HIMSELF don't know it, ez I found out only the
      other day in talking to him, I kalkilate I'm safe in sayin' that you're
      neither o' you quite up to Deacon Salisbury's darter in nat'ral cuteness.
      I don't like to obtrude my opinion, Squire Blandford, ez we're old
      friends, but I do say, that wot with Demorest's prematooriness and yer own
      hangfiredness, it's a good thing that you two worldly men hev got Joan
      Salisbury to stand up for North Liberty and keep it from bein' scandalized
      by the ungodly. Ef it hadn't been for her smartness, whar y'd both be
      landed now? There's a heap in Christian bringin' up, and a power in grace,
      Squire Blandford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hard, dry face was for an instant transfigured by a grim fealty and
      the dull glow of some sectarian clannishness. Or was it possible that this
      woman's personality had in some mysterious way disturbed his rooted
      selfishness?
    </p>
    <p>
      During his speech Blandford had walked to the window. When Corwin had
      ceased speaking, Blandford turned towards him with an equally changed face
      and cold imperturbability that astonished him, and held out his hand. &ldquo;Let
      bygones be bygones, Corwin&mdash;whether we ever meet again or not. Yet if
      I can do anything for you for the sake of old times, I am ready to do it.
      I have some power here and in San Francisco,&rdquo; he continued, with a slight
      touch of pride, &ldquo;that isn't dependent upon the mere name I may travel
      under. I have a purpose in coming here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, dryly. &ldquo;I heard it all from your two friends.
      You're huntin' some man that did you an injury.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm hunting down a dog who, suspecting I had some secret in emigrating
      here, tried to blackmail and ruin me,&rdquo; said Blandford, with a sudden
      expression of hatred that seemed inconsistent with anything that Ezekiel
      had ever known of his old master's character&mdash;&ldquo;a scoundrel who tried
      to break up my new life as another had broken up the old.&rdquo; He stopped and
      recovered himself with a short laugh. &ldquo;Well, Ezekiel, I don't know as his
      opinion of me was any worse than yours or HERS. And until I catch HIM to
      clear my name again, I let the other slanderers go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I reckon you might lay hands on that devil yet, and not far away,
      either. I was up at Demorest's to-day, and I heard Joan and a skittish
      sort o' Mexican young lady talkin' about some tramp that had frightened
      her. And Miss Pico said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Who did you say?&rdquo; demanded Blandford, with a violent start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I reckoned I heerd the first name too&mdash;Rosita.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quick flush crossed Blandford's face, and left it glowing like a boy's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is SHE there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I reckon she's visitin' Joan,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, narrowly attentive of
      Blandford's strange excitement; &ldquo;but wot of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Blandford had utterly forgotten Ezekiel's presence. He had remained
      speechless and flushed. And then, as if suddenly dazzled by an
      inspiration, he abruptly dashed from the room. Ezekiel heard him call to
      his passive host with a Spanish oath, but before he could follow, they had
      both hurriedly left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel glanced around him and contemplatively ran his fingers through his
      beard. &ldquo;It ain't Joan Salisbury nor Dick Demorest ez giv' him that start!
      Humph! Wa'al&mdash;I wanter know!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Demorest was so fascinated by the company of Dona Rosita Pico and her
      romantic memories, that she prevailed upon that heart-broken but scarcely
      attenuated young lady to prolong her visit beyond the fortnight she had
      allotted to communion with the past. For a day or two following her
      singular experience in the garden, Mrs. Demorest plied her with questions
      regarding the apparition she had seen, and finally extorted from her the
      admission that she could not positively swear to its being the real
      Johnson, or even a perfectly consistent shade of that faithless man. When
      Joan pointed out to her that such masculine perfections as curling raven
      locks, long silken mustachios, and dark eyes, were attributes by no means
      exclusive to her lover, but were occasionally seen among other less
      favored and even equally dangerous Americans, Dona Rosita assented with
      less objection than Joan anticipated. &ldquo;Besides, dear,&rdquo; said Joan, eying
      her with feline watchfulness, &ldquo;it is four years since you've seen him, and
      surely the man has either shaved since, or else he took a ridiculous vow
      never to do it, and then he would be more fully bearded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Dona Rosita only shook her pretty head. &ldquo;Ah, but he have an air&mdash;a
      something I know not what you call&mdash;so.&rdquo; She threw her shawl over her
      left shoulder, and as far as a pair of soft blue eyes and comfortably
      pacific features would admit, endeavored to convey an idea of wicked and
      gloomy abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You child,&rdquo; said Joan,&mdash;&ldquo;that's nothing; they all of them do that.
      Why, there was a stranger at the Oriental Hotel whom I met twice when I
      was there&mdash;just as mysterious, romantic, and wicked-looking. And in
      fact they hinted terrible things about him. Well! so much so, that Mr.
      Demorest was quite foolish about my being barely civil to him&mdash;you
      understand&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly, with a heightened color
      under the fire of Rosita's laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;so&mdash;Dona Discretion! Tell to me all. Did our hoosband eat
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joan's features suddenly tightened to their old puritan rigidity. &ldquo;Mr.
      Demorest has reasons&mdash;abundant reasons&mdash;to thoroughly understand
      and trust me,&rdquo; she replied in an austere voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosita looked at her a moment in mystification and then shrugged her
      shoulders. The conversation dropped. Nevertheless, it is worthy of being
      recorded that from that moment the usual familiar allusions, playful and
      serious, to Rosita's mysterious visitor began to diminish in frequency and
      finally ceased. Even the news brought by Demorest of some vague rumor in
      the pueblo that an intended attack on the stage-coach had been frustrated
      by the authorities, and that the vicinity had been haunted by incognitos
      of both parties, failed to revive the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the slight excitement that had stirred the sluggish life of the
      pueblo of San Buenaventura had subsided. The posada of Senor Mateo had
      lost its feverish and perplexing dual life; the alley behind it no longer
      was congested by lounging cigarette smokers; the compartment looking upon
      the silent patio was unoccupied, and its chairs and tables were empty. The
      two deputy sheriffs, of whom Senor Mateo presumably knew very little, had
      fled; and the mysterious Senor Johnson, of whom he&mdash;still presumably&mdash;knew
      still less, had also disappeared. For Senor Mateo's knowledge of what
      transpired in and about his posada, and of the character and purposes of
      those who frequented it, was tinctured by grave and philosophical doubts.
      This courteous and dignified scepticism generally took the formula of
      quien sabe to all frivolous and mundane inquiry. He would affirm with
      strict verity that his omelettes were unapproachable, his beds miraculous,
      his aguardiente supreme, his house was even as your own. Beyond these were
      questions with which the simply finite and always discreet human intellect
      declined to grapple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disturbing effect of Senor Corwin upon a mind thus gravely constituted
      may be easily imagined. Besides Ezekiel's inordinate capacity for useless
      or indiscreet information, it was undeniable that his patent medicines had
      effected a certain peaceful revolutionary movement in San Buenaventura. A
      simple and superstitious community that had steadily resisted the
      practical domestic and agricultural American improvements, succumbed to
      the occult healing influences of the Panacea and Jones's Bitters. The
      virtues of a mysterious balsam, more or less illuminated with a colored
      mythological label, deeply impressed them; and the exhibition of a
      circular, whereon a celestial visitant was represented as descending with
      a gross of Rogers' Pills to a suffering but admiring multitude, touched
      their religious sympathies to such an extent that the good Padre Jose was
      obliged to warn them from the pulpit of the diabolical character of their
      heresies of healing&mdash;with the natural result of yet more dangerously
      advertising Ezekiel. There were those too who spoke under their breath of
      the miraculous efficacy of these nostrums. Had not Don Victor Arguello,
      whose respectable digestion, exhausted by continuous pepper and garlic,
      failed him suddenly, received an unexpected and pleasurable stimulus from
      the New England rum, which was the basis of the Jones Bitters? Had not the
      baker, tremulous from excessive aguardiente, been soothed and sustained by
      the invisible morphia, judiciously hidden in Blogg's Nerve Tonic? Nor had
      the wily Ezekiel forgotten the weaker sex in their maiden and maternal
      requirements. Unguents, that made silken their black but somewhat coarsely
      fibrous tresses, opened charming possibilities to the Senoritas; while
      soothing syrups lent a peaceful repose to many a distracted mother's
      household. The success of Ezekiel was so marked as to justify his return
      at the end of three weeks with a fresh assortment and an undiminished
      audacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on his second visit that the sceptical, non-committal policy of
      Senor Mateo was sorely tried. Arriving at the posada one night, Ezekiel
      became aware that his host was engaged in some mysterious conference with
      a visitor who had entered through the ordinary public room. The view which
      the acute Ezekiel managed to get of the stranger, however, was productive
      of no further discovery than that he bore a faint and disreputable
      resemblance to Blandford, and was handsome after a conscious, reckless
      fashion, with an air of mingled bravado and conceit. But an hour later, as
      Corwin was taking the cooler air of the veranda before retiring to one of
      the miraculous beds of the posada, he was amazed at seeing what was
      apparently Blandford himself emerge on horseback from the alley, and after
      a quick glance towards the veranda, canter rapidly up the street.
      Ezekiel's first impression was to call to him, but the sudden recollection
      that he parted from his old master on confidential terms only three days
      before in San Francisco, and that it was impossible for him to be in the
      pueblo, stopped him with his fingers meditatively in his beard. Then he
      turned in to the posada, and hastily summoned Mateo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman presented himself in a state of such profound scepticism
      that it seemed to have already communicated itself to his shoulders, and
      gave him the appearance of having shrugged himself into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha'ow long ago did Mr. Johnson get here?&rdquo; asked Corwin, lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;possibly&mdash;then there has been a Mr. Johnson?&rdquo; This is a
      polite doubt of his own perceptions and a courteous acceptance of his
      questioner's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I guess so. Considerin' I jest saw him with my own eyes,&rdquo; returned
      Ezekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Mateo was relieved. Might he congratulate the Senor Corwin, who must
      be also relieved, and shake his respected hand. Bueno. And then he had met
      this Senor Johnson? doubtless a friend? And he was well? and all were
      happy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look yer, Mattayo! What I wanter know ez THIS. When did that man, who has
      just ridden out of your alley, come here? Sabe that&mdash;it's a plain
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah surely, of the clearest comprehension. Bueno. It may have been last
      week&mdash;or even this week&mdash;or perhaps yesterday&mdash;or of a
      possibility to-day. The Senor Corwin, who was wise and omniscient, would
      comprehend that the difficulty lay in deciding WHO was that man. Perhaps a
      friend of the Senor Corwin&mdash;perhaps only one who LOOKED like him.
      There existed&mdash;might Mateo point out&mdash;a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel regarded Mateo with a certain grim appreciation. &ldquo;Wa'al, is there
      anybody here who looks like Johnson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again there were the difficulty of ascertaining perfectly how the Senor
      Johnson looked. If the Senor Johnson was Americano, doubtless there were
      other Americanos who had resembled him. It was possible. The Senor Corwin
      had doubtless observed for a little space a caballero who was here, as it
      were, in the instant of the appearance of Senor Johnson? Possibly there
      was a resemblance, and yet&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Corwin had certainly noticed this resemblance, but it did not suit his
      cautious intellect to fall in with any prevailing scepticism of his host.
      Satisfied in his mind that Mateo was concealing something from him, and
      equally satisfied that he would sooner or later find it out, he grinned
      diabolically in the face of that worthy man, and sought the meditation of
      his miraculous couch. When he had departed, the sceptic turned to his
      wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This animal has been sniffing at the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly&mdash;but Mother of God&mdash;where is the discretion of our
      friend. If he will continue to haunt the pueblo like a lovesick chicken,
      he will get his neck wrung yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following out an ingenious idea of his own, Ezekiel called the next day on
      the Demorests, and in some occult fashion obtained an invitation to stay
      under their hospitable roof during his sojourn in Buenaventura. Perfectly
      aware that he owed this courtesy more to Joan than to her husband, it is
      probable that his grim enjoyment was not diminished by the fact; while
      Joan, for reasons of her own, preferred the constraint which the presence
      of another visitor put upon Demorest's uxoriousness. Of late, too, there
      were times when Dona Rosita's naive intelligence, which was not unlike the
      embarrassing perceptions of a bright and half-spoiled child, was in her
      way, and she would willingly have shared the young lady's company with her
      husband had Demorest shown any sympathy for the girl. It was in the faint
      hope that Ezekiel might in some way beguile Rosita's wandering attention
      that she had invited him. The only difficulty lay in his uncouthness, and
      in presenting to the heiress of the Picos a man who had been formerly her
      own servant. Had she attempted to conceal that fact she was satisfied that
      Ezekiel's independence and natural predilection for embarrassing
      situations would have inevitably revealed it. She had even gone so far as
      to consider the propriety of investing him with a poor relationship to her
      family, when Dona Rosita herself happily stopped all further trouble. On
      her very first introduction to him, that charming young lady at once
      accepted him as a lunatic whose brains were turned by occult, scientific,
      and medical study! Ah! she, Rosita, had heard of such cases before. Had
      not a paternal ancestor of hers, one Don Diego Castro, believed he had
      discovered the elixir of youth. Had he not to that end refused even to
      wash him the hand, to cut him the nail of the finger and the hair of the
      head! Exalted by that discovery, had he not been unsparingly
      uncomplimentary to all humanity, especially to the weaker sex? Even as the
      Senor Corwin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Far from being offended at this ingenious interpretation of his character,
      Ezekiel exhibited a dry gratification over it, and even conceived an
      unwholesome admiration of the fair critic; he haunted her presence and
      preoccupied her society far beyond Joan's most sanguine expectations. He
      sat in open-mouthed enjoyment of her at the table, he waylaid her in the
      garden, he attempted to teach her English. Dona Rosita received these
      extraordinary advances in a no less extraordinary manner. In the scant
      masculine atmosphere of the house, and the somewhat rigid New England
      reserve that still pervaded it, perhaps she languished a little, and was
      not averse to a slight flirtation, even with a madman. Besides, she
      assumed the attitude of exercising a wholesome restraint over him. &ldquo;If we
      are not found dead in our bed one morning, and extracted of our blood for
      a cordial, you shall thank to me for it,&rdquo; she said to Joan. &ldquo;Also for the
      not empoisoning of the coffee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she permitted him to carry a chair or hammock for her into the garden,
      to fetch the various articles which she was continually losing, and which
      he found with his usual penetration; and to supply her with information,
      in which, however, he exercised an unwonted caution. On the other hand,
      certain naive recollections and admissions, which in the quality of a
      voluble child she occasionally imparted to this &ldquo;madman&rdquo; in return, were
      in the proportion of three to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a hot day, and even the usual sunset breeze had failed that
      evening to rock the tops of the outlying pine-trees or cool the heated
      tiles of the pueblo roofs. There was a hush and latent expectancy in the
      air that reacted upon the people with feverish unrest and uneasiness; even
      a lull in the faintly whispering garden around the Demorests' casa had
      affected the spirits of its inmates, causing them to wander about in vague
      restlessness. Joan had disappeared; Dona Rosita, under an olive-tree in
      one of the deserted paths, and attended by the faithful Ezekiel, had said
      it was &ldquo;earthquake weather,&rdquo; and recalled, with a sign of the cross, a
      certain dreadful day of her childhood, when el temblor had shaken down one
      of the Mission towers. &ldquo;You shall see it now, as he have left it so it has
      remain always,&rdquo; she added with superstitious gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just the lazy shiftlessness of your folks,&rdquo; responded Ezekiel with
      prompt ungallantry. &ldquo;It ain't no wonder the Lord Almighty hez to stir you
      up now and then to keep you goin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dona Rosita gazed at him with simple childish pity. &ldquo;Poor man; it have
      affect you also in the head, this weather. So! It was even so with the
      uncle of my father. Hush up yourself, and bring to me the box of
      chocolates of my table. I will gif to you one. You shall for one time have
      something pleasant on the end of your tongue, even if you must swallow him
      after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel grinned. &ldquo;Ye ain't afraid o' bein' left alone with the ghost that
      haunts the garden, Miss Rosita?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After YOU&mdash;never-r-r.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll find Mrs. Demorest and send her to ye,&rdquo; said Ezekiel, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, to attract here the ghost? Thank you, no, very mooch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel's face contracted until nothing but his bright peering gray eyes
      could be seen. &ldquo;Attract the ghost!&rdquo; he echoed. &ldquo;Then you kalkilate that
      it's&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped, insinuatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rosita brought her fan sharply over his knuckles, and immediately opened
      it again over her half-embarrassed face. &ldquo;I comprehend not anything to
      'ekalkilate.' WILL you go, Don Fantastico; or is it for me to bring to
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel flew. He quickly found the chocolates and returned, but was
      disconcerted on arriving under the olive-tree to find Dona Rosita no
      longer in the hammock. He turned into a by-path, where an extraordinary
      circumstance attracted his attention. The air was perfectly still, but the
      leaves of a manzanita bush near the misshapen cactus were slightly
      agitated. Presently Ezekiel saw the stealthy figure of a man emerge from
      behind it and approach the cactus. Reaching his hand cautiously towards
      the plant, the stranger detached something from one of its thorns, and
      instantly disappeared. The quick eyes of Ezekiel had seen that it was a
      letter, his unerring perception of faces recognized at the same moment
      that the intruder was none other than the handsome, reckless-looking man
      he had seen the other day in conference with Mateo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ezekiel was not the only witness of this strange intrusion. A few
      paces from him, Dona Rosita, unconscious of his return, was gazing in a
      half-frightened, breathless absorption in the direction of the stranger's
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al!&rdquo; drawled Ezekiel lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started and turned towards him. Her face was pale and alarmed, and yet
      to the critical eye of Ezekiel it seemed to wear an expression of
      gratified relief. She laughed faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef that's the kind o' ghost you hev about yer, it's a healthy one,&rdquo;
       drawled Ezekiel. He turned and fixed his keen eyes on Rosita's face. &ldquo;I
      wonder what kind o' fruit grows on the cactus that he's so fond of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Either she had not seen the abstraction of the letter, or his acting was
      perfect, for she returned his look unwaveringly. &ldquo;The fruit, eh? I have
      not comprehend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, I reckon I will,&rdquo; said Ezekiel. He walked towards the cactus;
      there was nothing to be seen but its thorny spikes. He was confronted,
      however, by the sudden apparition of Joan from behind the manzanita at its
      side. She looked up and glanced from Ezekiel to Dona Rosita with an
      agitated air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you saw him too?&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; answered Ezekiel, with his eyes still on Rosita. &ldquo;I was
      wondering what on airth he was so taken with that air cactus for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rosita had become slightly pale again in the presence of her friend. Joan
      quietly pushed Ezekiel aside and put her arm around her. &ldquo;Are you
      frightened again?&rdquo; she asked, in a low whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not mooch,&rdquo; returned Rosita, without lifting her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was only some peon, trespassing to pick blossoms for his sweetheart,&rdquo;
       she said significantly, with a glance towards Ezekiel. &ldquo;Let us go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She passed her hand through Rosita's passive arm and led her towards the
      house, Ezekiel's penetrating eyes still following Rosita with an
      expression of gratified doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once, however, that astute observer was wrong. When Mrs. Demorest had
      reached the house she slipped into her own room, and, bolting the door,
      drew from her bosom a letter which SHE had picked from the cactus thorn,
      and read it with a flushed face and eager eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may have been the effect of the phenomenal weather, but the next day a
      malign influence seemed to pervade the Demorest household. Dona Rosita was
      confined to her room by an attack of languid nerves, superinduced, as she
      was still voluble enough to declare, by the narcotic effect of some
      unknown herb which the lunatic Ezekiel had no doubt mysteriously
      administered to her with a view of experimenting on its properties. She
      even avowed that she must speedily return to Los Osos, before Ezekiel
      should further compromise her reputation by putting her on a colored label
      in place of the usual Celestial Distributer of the Panacea. Ezekiel
      himself, who had been singularly abstracted and reticent, and had
      absolutely foregone one or two opportunities of disagreeable criticism,
      had gone to the pueblo early that morning. The house was comparatively
      silent and deserted when Demorest walked into his wife's boudoir.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty room, looking upon the garden, furnished with a singular
      mingling of her own inherited formal tastes and the more sensuous coloring
      and abandon of her new life. There were a great many rugs and hangings
      scattered in disorder around the room, and apparently purposeless, except
      for color; there was a bamboo lounge as large as a divan, with two or
      three cushions disposed on it, and a low chair that seemed the incarnation
      of indolence. Opposed to this, on the wall, was the rigid picture of her
      grandfather, who had apparently retired with his volume further into the
      canvas before the spectacle of this ungodly opulence; a large Bible on a
      funereal trestle-like stand, and the primmest and barest of
      writing-tables, before which she was standing as at a sacrificial altar.
      With an almost mechanical movement she closed her portfolio as her husband
      entered, and also shut the lid of a small box with a slight snap. This
      suggested exclusion of him from her previous occupation, whatever it might
      have been, caused a faint shadow of pain to pass across his loving eyes.
      He cast a glance at his wife as if mutely asking her to sit beside him,
      but she drew a chair to the table, and with her elbow resting on the box,
      resignedly awaited his speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to disturb you, darling,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;but as we were
      alone, I thought we might have one of our old-fashioned talks, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let it be so old-fashioned as to include North Liberty again,&rdquo; she
      interrupted, wearily. &ldquo;We've had quite enough of that since I returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you found fault with me then for forgetting the past. But let
      that pass, dear; it is not OUR affairs I wanted to talk to you about now,&rdquo;
       he said, stifling a sigh, &ldquo;it's about your friend. Please don't
      misunderstand what I am going to say; nor that I interpose except from
      necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned her dark brown eyes in his direction, but her glance passed
      abstractedly over his head into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a matter perfectly well known to me&mdash;and, I fear, to all our
      servants also&mdash;that somebody is making clandestine visits to our
      garden. I would not trouble you before, until I ascertained the object of
      these visits. It is quite plain to me now that Dona Rosita is that object,
      and that communications are secretly carried on between her and some
      unknown stranger. He has been here once or twice before; he was here again
      yesterday. Ezekiel saw him and saw her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Together?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Demorest, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it was evident that there was some understanding, and that some
      communication passed between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Mrs. Demorest, with repressed impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is equally evident, Joan, that this stranger is a man who does not
      dare to approach your friend in her own house, nor more openly in this;
      but who, with her connivance, uses us to carry on an intrigue which may be
      perfectly innocent, but is certainly compromising to all concerned. I am
      quite willing to believe that Dona Rosita is only romantic and reckless,
      but that will not prevent her from becoming a dupe of some rascal who dare
      not face us openly, and who certainly does not act as her equal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Rosita is no chicken, and you are not her guardian.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vague heartlessness, more in her voice than in her words, that
      touched him as her cold indifference to himself had never done, and for an
      instant stung his crushed spirit to revolt. &ldquo;No&rdquo; he said, sternly, &ldquo;but I
      am her father's FRIEND, and I shall not allow his daughter to be
      compromised under my roof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes sprang up to meet his in hatred as promptly as they once had met
      in love. &ldquo;And since when, Richard Demorest, have you become so
      particular?&rdquo; she began, with dry asperity. &ldquo;Since you lured ME from the
      side of my wedded husband? Since you met ME clandestinely in trains and
      made love to ME under an assumed name? Since you followed ME to my house
      under the pretext of being my husband's friend, and forced me&mdash;yes,
      forced me&mdash;to see you secretly under my mother's roof? Did you think
      of compromising ME then? Did you think of ruining my reputation, of
      driving my husband from his home in despair? Did you call yourself a
      rascal then? Did you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he said, in a voice that shook the rafters; &ldquo;I command you, stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had gradually worked herself from a deliberately insulting precision
      into an hysterical, and it is to be feared a virtuous, conviction of her
      wrongs. Beginning only with the instinct to taunt and wound the man before
      her, she had been led by a secret consciousness of something else he did
      not know to anticipate his reproach and justify herself in a wild feminine
      abandonment of emotion. But she stopped at his words. For a moment she was
      even thrilled again by the strength and imperiousness she had loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were facing each other after five years of mistaken passion, even as
      they had faced each other that night in her mother's kitchen. But the
      grave of that dead passion yawned between them. It was Joan who broke the
      silence, that after her single outburst seemed to fill and oppress the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As far as Rosita is concerned,&rdquo; she said, with affected calmness, &ldquo;she is
      going to-night. And you probably will not be troubled any longer by your
      mysterious visitor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether he heeded the sarcastic significance of her last sentence, or even
      heard her at all, he did not reply. For a moment he turned his blazing
      eyes full upon her, and then without a word strode from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked to the door and stood uneasily listening in the passage until
      she heard the clatter of hoofs in the paved patio, and knew that he had
      ordered his horse. Then she turned back relieved to her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already sunset when Demorest drew rein again at the entrance of the
      corral, and the last stroke of the Angelus was ringing from the Mission
      tower. He looked haggard and exhausted, and his horse was flecked with
      foam and dirt. Wherever he had been, or for what object, or whether,
      objectless and dazed, he had simply sought to lose himself in aimlessly
      wandering over the dry yellow hills or in careering furiously among his
      own wild cattle on the arid, brittle plain; whether he had beaten all
      thought from his brain with the jarring leap of his horse, or whether he
      had pursued some vague and elusive determination to his own door, is not
      essential to this brief chronicle. Enough that when he dismounted he drew
      a pistol from his holster and replaced it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just pushed open the gate of the corral as he led in his horse by
      the bridle, when he noticed another horse tethered among some cotton woods
      that shaded the outer wall of his garden. As he gazed, the figure of a man
      swung lightly from one of the upper boughs of a cotton-wood on the wall
      and disappeared on the other side. It was evidently the clandestine
      visitor. Demorest was in no mood for trifling. Hurriedly driving his horse
      into the enclosure with a sharp cut of his riata, he closed the gate upon
      him, slipped past the intervening space into the patio, and then unnoticed
      into the upper part of the garden. Taking a narrow by-path in the
      direction of the cotton woods that could be seen above the wall, he
      presently came in sight of the object of his search moving stealthily
      towards the house. It was the work of a moment only to dash forward and
      seize him, to find himself engaged in a sharp wrestle, to half draw his
      pistol as he struggled with his captive in the open. But once in the
      clearer light, he started, his grasp of the stranger relaxed, and he fell
      back in bewildered terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edward Blandford! Good God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pistol had dropped from his hand as he leaned breathless against a
      tree. The stranger kicked the weapon contemptuously aside. Then quietly
      adjusting his disordered dress, and picking the brambles from his sleeve,
      he said with the same air of disdain, &ldquo;Yes! Edward Blandford, whom you
      thought dead! There! I'm not a ghost&mdash;though you tried to make me one
      this time,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Demorest passed his hand across his white face. &ldquo;Then it's you&mdash;and
      you have come here for&mdash;for&mdash;Joan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Joan?&rdquo; echoed Blandford, with a quick scornful laugh, that made the
      blood flow back into Demorest's face as from a blow, and recalled his
      scattered senses. &ldquo;For Joan,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Not much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men were facing each other in irreconcilable yet confused
      antagonism. Both were still excited and combative from their late physical
      struggle, but with feelings so widely different that it would have been
      impossible for either to have comprehended the other. In the figure that
      had apparently risen from the dead to confront him, Demorest only saw the
      man he had unconsciously wronged&mdash;the man who had it in his power to
      claim Joan and exact a terrible retribution! But it was part of this
      monstrous and irreconcilable situation that Blandford had ceased to
      contemplate it, and in his preoccupation only saw the actual interference
      of a man whom he no longer hated, but had begun to pity and despise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced coolly around him. &ldquo;Whatever we've got to say to each other,&rdquo;
       he said deliberately, &ldquo;had better not be overheard. At least what I have
      got to say to you.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <p>
      Demorest, now as self-possessed as his adversary, haughtily waved his hand
      towards the path. They walked on in silence, without even looking at each
      other, until they reached a small summer-house that stood in the angle of
      the wall. Demorest entered. &ldquo;We cannot be heard here,&rdquo; he said curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we can see what is going on. Good,&rdquo; said Blandford, coolly following
      him. The summer-house contained a bench and a table. Blandford seated
      himself on the bench. Demorest remained standing beside the table. There
      was a moment's silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here with no desire to see you or avoid you,&rdquo; said Blandford, with
      cold indifference. &ldquo;A few weeks ago I might perhaps have avoided you, for
      your own sake. But since then I have learned that among the many things I
      owe to&mdash;to your wife is the fact that five years ago she secretly
      DIVORCED ME, and that consequently my living presence could neither be a
      danger nor a menace to you. I see,&rdquo; he added, dryly, with a quick glance
      at Demorest's horror-stricken face, &ldquo;that I was also told the truth when
      they said you were as ignorant of the divorce as I was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, half in pity of his adversary's shame, half in surprise of his
      own calmness. Five years before, in the tumultuous consciousness of his
      wrongs, he would have scarcely trusted himself face to face with the
      cooler and more self-controlled Demorest. He wondered at and partly
      admired his own coolness now, in the presence of his enemy's confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As your mind is at rest on that point,&rdquo; he continued, sarcastically, &ldquo;I
      don't suppose you care to know what became of ME when I left North
      Liberty. But as it happens to have something to do with my being here
      to-night, and is a part of my business with you, you'll have to listen to
      it. Sit down! Very well, then&mdash;stand up! It's your own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His half cynical, wholly contemptuous ignoring of the real issue between
      them was more crushing to Demorest than the keenest reproach or most
      tragic outburst. He did not lift his eyes as Blandford resumed in a dry,
      business-like way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came across the plains to California, I fell in with a man about
      my own age&mdash;an emigrant also. I suppose I looked and acted like a
      crazy fool through all the journey, for he satisfied himself that I had
      some secret reason for leaving the States, and suspected that I was, like
      himself&mdash;a criminal. I afterwards learned that he was an escaped
      thief and assassin. Well, he played upon me all the way here, for I didn't
      care to reveal my real trouble to him, lest it should get back to North
      liberty&mdash;&rdquo; He interrupted himself with a sarcastic laugh. &ldquo;Of course,
      you understand that all this while Joan was getting her divorce unknown to
      me, and you were marrying her&mdash;yet as I didn't know anything about it
      I let him compromise me to save her. But&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped, his eye
      kindled, and, losing his self-control in what to Demorest seemed some
      incoherent passion, went on excitedly: &ldquo;that man continued his persecution
      HERE&mdash;yes, HERE, in this very house, where I was a trusted and
      honored guest, and threatened to expose me to a pure, innocent, simple
      girl who had taken pity on me&mdash;unless I helped him in a conspiracy of
      cattle-stealers and road agents, of which he was chief. I was such a
      cursed sentimental fool then, that believing him capable of doing this,
      believing myself still the husband of that woman, your wife, and to spare
      that innocent girl the shame of thinking me a villain, I purchased his
      silence by consenting. May God curse me for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had started to his feet with flashing eyes, and the indication of an
      overmastering passion that to Demorest, absorbed only in the stupefying
      revelation of his wife's divorce and the horrible doubt it implied, seemed
      utterly vacant and unmeaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often dreamed of Blandford as standing before him, reproachful,
      indignant, and even desperate over his wife's unfaithfulness; but this
      insane folly and fury over some trivial wrong done to that plump,
      baby-faced, flirting Dona Rosita, crushed him by its unconscious but
      degrading obliteration of Joan and himself more than the most violent
      denunciation. Dazed and bewildered, yet with the instinct of a helpless
      man, he clung only to that part of Blandford's story which indicated that
      he had come there for Rosita, and not to separate him from Joan, and even
      turned to his former friend with a half-embarrassed gesture of apology as
      he stammered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it was YOU who were Rosita's lover, and you who have been here to
      see her. Forgive me, Ned&mdash;if I had only known it.&rdquo; He stopped and
      timidly extended his hand. But Blandford put it aside with a cold gesture
      and folded his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten all you ever knew of me, Demorest! I am not in the
      habit of making clandestine appointments with helpless women whose natural
      protectors I dare not face. I have never pursued an innocent girl to the
      house I dared not enter. When I found that I could not honorably retain
      Dona Rosita's affection, I fled her roof. When I believed that even if I
      broke with this scoundrel&mdash;as I did&mdash;I was still legally if not
      morally tied to your wife, and could not marry Rosita, I left her never to
      return. And I tore my heart out to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tears were standing in his eyes. Demorest regarded him again with
      vacant wonder. Tears!&mdash;not for Joan's unfaithfulness to him&mdash;but
      for this silly girl's transitory sentimentalism. It was horrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet what was Joan to Blandford now? Why should he weep for the woman
      who had never loved him&mdash;whom he loved no longer? The woman who had
      deceived him&mdash;who had deceived them BOTH. Yes! for Joan must have
      suspected that Blandford was living to have sought her secret divorce&mdash;and
      yet she had never told him&mdash;him&mdash;the man for whom she got it.
      Ah! he must not forget THAT! It was to marry him that she had taken that
      step. It was perhaps a foolish caution&mdash;a mistaken reservation; but
      it was the folly&mdash;the mistake of a loving woman. He hugged this
      belief the closer, albeit he was conscious at the same time of following
      Blandford's story of his alienated affection with a feeling of wonder and
      envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the result of this touching sacrifice?&rdquo; continued Blandford,
      trying to resume his former cynical indifference. &ldquo;I'll tell you. This
      scoundrel set himself about to supplant me. Taking advantage of my
      absence, his knowledge that her affection for me was heightened by the
      mystery of my life, and trusting to profit by a personal resemblance he is
      said to bear to me, he began to haunt her. Lately he has grown bolder, and
      he dared even to communicate with her here. For it is he,&rdquo; he continued,
      again giving way to his passion, &ldquo;this dog, this sneaking coward, who
      visits the place unknown to you, and thinks to entrap the poor girl
      through her memory of me. And it is he that I came here to prevent, to
      expose&mdash;if necessary to kill! Don't misunderstand me. I have made
      myself a deputy of the law for that purpose. I've a warrant in my pocket,
      and I shall take him, this mongrel, half-breed Cherokee Bob, by fair means
      or foul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The energy and presence of his passion was so infectious that it
      momentarily swept away Demorest's doubts of the past. &ldquo;And I will help
      you, before God, Blandford,&rdquo; he said eagerly. &ldquo;And Joan shall, too. She
      will find out from Rosita how far&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; interrupted Blandford, dryly; &ldquo;but your wife has already
      interfered in this matter, to my cost. It is to her, I believe, I owe this
      wretch's following Rosita here. She already knows this man&mdash;has met
      him twice in San Francisco; he even boasts of YOUR jealousy. You know best
      how far he lied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Demorest had braced himself against the chill sensation that had begun
      to creep over him as Blandford spoke. He nerved himself and said, proudly,
      &ldquo;I forbade her knowing him on account of his reputation solely. I have no
      reason to believe she has ever even wished to disobey me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smile of scorn that had kindled in Blandford's eyes, darkened with a
      swift shadow of compassion as he glanced at Demorest's hard, ashen face.
      He held out his hand with a sudden impulse. &ldquo;Enough, I accept your offer,
      and shall put it to the test this very night. I know&mdash;if you do not&mdash;that
      Rosita is to leave here for Los Osos an hour from now in a private
      carriage, which your wife has ordered especially for her. The same
      information tells me that this villain and another of his gang will be in
      wait for the carriage three miles out of the pueblo to attack it and carry
      off the young girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad!&rdquo; said Demorest, in unfeigned amazement. &ldquo;Do you believe them
      capable of attacking a private carriage and carrying off a solitary,
      defenceless woman? Come, Blandford, this is a school-girl romance&mdash;not
      an act of mercenary highwaymen&mdash;least of all Cherokee Bob and his
      gang. This is some madness of Rosita's, surely,&rdquo; he continued with a
      forced laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does this mean that you think better of your promise?&rdquo; asked Blandford,
      dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I was at your service,&rdquo; said Demorest, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hear my plan to prevent it, and yet take that dog in the act,&rdquo; said
      Blandford. &ldquo;But we must first wait here till the last moment to ascertain
      if he makes any signal to show that his plan is altered, or that he has
      discovered he is watched.&rdquo; He turned, and in his preoccupation laid his
      hand for an instant upon Demorest's shoulder with the absent familiarity
      of old days. Unconscious as the action was, it thrilled them both&mdash;from
      its very unconsciousness&mdash;and impelled them to throw themselves into
      the new alliance with such feverish and excited activity in order to
      preclude any dangerous alien reflection, that when they rose a few moments
      later and cautiously left the garden arm-in-arm through the outer gates,
      no one would have believed they had ever been estranged, least of all the
      clever woman who had separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly nine o'clock when the two friends, accompanied by the
      sheriff of the county, left San Buenaventura turnpike and turned into a
      thicket of alders to wait the coming of the carriage they were to
      henceforth follow cautiously and unseen in a parallel trail to the main
      road. The moon had risen, and with it the long withheld wind that now
      swept over the distant stretch of gleaming road and partly veiled it at
      times with flying dust unchecked by any dew from the clear cold sky.
      Demorest shivered even with his ready hand on his revolver. Suddenly the
      sheriff uttered an exclamation of disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blasted if thar ain't some one in the road between us and their ambush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's one of their gang&mdash;scouting. Lie close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scout be darned. Look at him bucking round there in the dust. He can't
      even ride! It's some blasted greenhorn taking a pasear on a hoss for the
      first time. Damnation! he's ruined everything. They'll take the alarm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll push on and clear him out,&rdquo; said Blandford, excitedly. &ldquo;Even if
      they're off, I may yet get a shot at the Cherokee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quick then,&rdquo; said Demorest, &ldquo;for here comes the carriage.&rdquo; He pointed to
      a dark spot on the road occasionally emerging from the driven dust clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Blandford was at the heels of the awkward horseman, who
      wheeled clumsily at his approach and revealed the lank figure of Ezekiel
      Corwin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You here!&rdquo; said Blandford, in stupefied fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, yes, squire,&rdquo; said Ezekiel lazily, in spite of his uneasy seat. &ldquo;I
      kalkilated ef there was suthin' goin' on, I'd like to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cursed prying fool! you've spoiled all. There!&rdquo; he shouted
      despairingly, as the quick clatter of hoofs rang from the arroyo behind
      them, &ldquo;there they go! That's your work, blockhead! Out of my way, or by
      God&mdash;&rdquo; but the sentence was left unfinished as, joined by the
      sheriff, who had galloped up at the sound of the robbers' flight, he
      darted past the unconcerned Ezekiel. Demorest would have followed, but
      Blandford, with a warning cry to him to remain and protect the carriage,
      halted him at the side of Corwin as the vehicle now rapidly approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ezekiel was before him even then, and as the driver pulled up, that
      inquiring man tumbled from his horse, ran to the door and opened it.
      Demorest rode up, glanced into the carriage, and fell back in blank
      amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his wife who was sitting there alone, pale, erect, and beautiful.
      By some illusion of the moonlight, her face and figure, covered with soft
      white wrappings for a journey, looked as he remembered to have seen her
      the first night they had met in the Boston train. The picture was
      completed by the traveling bag and rug that lay on the seat before her.
      Another terrible foreboding seized him; his brain reeled. Was he going
      mad?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;You? What is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel whom but for his dazed condition he might have seen violently
      contorting his features in Joan's face, presumably in equal astonishment&mdash;broke
      into a series of discordant chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wa'al, ef that ain't Deacon Salisbury's darter all over. Ha! Here are ye
      two men folks makin' no end o' fuss to save that Mexican gal with pistols
      and ambushes and plots and counterplots, and yer's Joan Salisbury shows ye
      the way ha'ow to do it. And so, ma'am, you succeeded in fixin' it up with
      Dona Rosita to take her place and just sell them robbers cheap! Wa'al,
      ma'am, yer sold this yer party, too&mdash;for&rdquo;&mdash;he advanced his face
      close to hers&mdash;&ldquo;I never let on a word, though I knew it, and although
      they nearly knocked me off my hoss in their fuss and fury. Ha! ha! They
      wanted to know what I was doin' here, he-he! Tell 'em, Joan, tell 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Demorest gazed from one to another with a troubled face, yet one on which
      a faint relief was breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean, Joan? Speak,&rdquo; he said, almost imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joan, whose color was slightly returning, drew herself up with her old
      cold Puritan precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the scene you made this morning, Richard, when you chose to accuse
      your wife of unfaithfulness to her friend, her guest, and even your
      reputation, I resolved to go myself with Dona Rosita to Los Osos and
      explain the matter to her father. Some rumor of the ridiculous farce I
      have just witnessed reached us through Ezekiel, and frightened the poor
      girl so that she declined&mdash;and properly, too to face the hoax which
      you and some nameless impersonator of a disgraced fugitive have gotten up
      for purposes of your own! I wish you joy of your work! If the play is over
      now, I presume I may be allowed to proceed on my journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Demorest slowly, with a face over which the chasing doubts
      had at last settled in a grayish pallor. &ldquo;Believe what you like,
      misunderstand me if you will, laugh at the danger you perhaps comprehend
      better than I do, but upon this road, wherever or to whatever it was
      leading you&mdash;to-night you go no further!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I suppose I may return home,&rdquo; she said coldly. &ldquo;Ezekiel will
      accompany me back to protect me from&mdash;robbers. Come, Ezekiel. Mr.
      Demorest and his friends can be safely trusted to take care of&mdash;your
      horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the grinning Ezekiel sprang into the carriage beside her, she
      pulled up the glass in the fateful and set face of her once trusting
      husband; the carriage turned and drove off, leaving him like a statue in
      the road.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The bell of the North Liberty Second Presbyterian Church had just ceased
      ringing. But in the last five years it had rung out the bass viol and
      harmonium, and rung in an organ and choir; and the old austere interior
      had been subjected at the hands of the rising generation to an invasion of
      youthful warmth and color. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the
      choir itself, where the bright spring sunshine, piercing a newly-opened
      stained-glass window, picked out the new spring bonnet of Mrs. Demorest
      and settled upon it during the singing of the hymn. Perhaps that was the
      reason why a few eyes were curiously directed in that direction, and that
      even the minister himself strayed from the precise path of doctrine to
      allude with ecclesiastical vagueness to certain shining examples of the
      Christian virtues that were &ldquo;again in our midst.&rdquo; The shrewd face and
      white eyelashes of Ezekiel Corwin, junior partner in the firm of Dilworth
      &amp; Dusenberry, of San Francisco, were momentarily raised towards the
      choir, and then relapsed into an expression of fatigued
      self-righteousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over a few worshipers lingered near the choir
      staircase, mindful of the spring bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks quite nat'ral,&rdquo; said Deacon Fairchild, &ldquo;ter see Joan Salisbury
      attendin' the ministration of the Word agin. And I ain't sorry she didn't
      bring that second husband of hers with her. It kinder looks like old times&mdash;afore
      Edward Blandford was gathered to the Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so,&rdquo; replied his auditor meekly, &ldquo;and they do say ez ha'ow
      Demorest got more powerful worldly and unregenerate in that heathen
      country, and that Joan ez a professin' Christian had to leave him. I've
      heerd tell thet he'd got mixed up, out thar, with some half-breed outlaw,
      of the name o' Johnson, ez hez a purty, high-flyin' Mexican wife. It was
      fort'nit for Joan that she found a friend in grace in Brother Corwin to
      look arter her share in the property and bring her back tu hum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's lookin' peart,&rdquo; said Sister Bradley, &ldquo;though to my mind that bonnet
      savors still o' heathen vanities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Et's the new idees&mdash;crept in with that organ,&rdquo; groaned Deacon
      Fairchild; &ldquo;but&mdash;sho&mdash;thar she comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shone for an instant&mdash;a charming vision&mdash;out of the shadow
      of the choir stairs, and then glided primly into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sexton, still in waiting with his hand on the half-closed door,
      paused and looked after her with a troubled brow. A singular and utterly
      incomprehensible recollection and resemblance had just crossed his mind.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
